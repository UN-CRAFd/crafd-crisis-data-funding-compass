- use Next.js v15.4 (https://nextjs.org/docs)
- ALWAYS use code for Tailwind CSS v4
  - make sure to consult https://tailwindcss.com/docs/ to update your knowledge since many things that you think would work are actually outdated
  - importantly, custom theming should use `@theme` instead of `:root` in the `globals.css` instead of the old Tailwind theme implementation in `tailwind.config.ts`
- use colors from `globals.css` integrated into Tailwind CSS theme
- if you want to test run, use `npm run dev`
- use `shadcn/ui` components (https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components)
  - install via `npx shadcn@latest add`
  - installed primitves in `src/components/ui` should not be edited directly
- follow best practices for UI/UX and web development
- make sure to understand the general api and page structure before making singular changes
- do not create parallel infrastructures, prefer global solutions, do not hardcode things where it would be hard to find.
- the site is deployed to Vercel
