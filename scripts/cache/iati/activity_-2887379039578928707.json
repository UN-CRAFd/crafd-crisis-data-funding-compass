Composed of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union, the group will have Brazil as the hostess country in 2024 (from December 1, 2023 to November 30, 2024). One of the characteristics of the G20 is the existence of the so-called Sherpa and Finance tracks, with thematic sub-groups that meet regularly throughout the year, in dozens of face-to-face meetings in the country hosting the presidency.In particular, the Finance track is made up of the finance ministers or their equivalent and the presidents of the central banks of the member countries. These representatives discuss global economic and financial issues, such as fiscal policies, international trade, financial stability, and international financial architecture. Considering the urgency of time - the presidency begins in December 2023 - and the need to carry out short-term preparatory activities until the project is signed, it is considered opportune for UNDP to provide support in this preparatory phase."

      "The Gambia is characterized by increasing deforestation, land degradation, loss of biodiversity linked to loss of habitat, and coastal degradation. Environmental vulnerabilities range from fragility of the land coupled with adverse impacts of natural hazards worsened by the emerging impacts of climate change. Climate change affects the country’s agriculture, tourism, fisheries, forestry, health sectors, threatens the livelihoods of people, reduces the resilience of ecosystems, adaptative capacities of communities, and contributes to unsustainable economic growth. The upland watershed ecosystem has been disturbed and degraded largely due to high population pressure on limited natural resources, increased erosion caused by high water runoff rates, drying of inland valleys and river tributaries, and water stress for crops and livestock. Over the years rapid growth in population as well as urbanization has contributed to deterioration of the environment. The natural forest continues to disappear or at least deteriorate due to high demand for fuel wood, charcoal and timber which has led to increase felling of trees. Despite its progressive development, The Gambia is still characterized by pervasive and limited chemicals and waste management infrastructure and services. It is estimated that the nation generates over 438 tons/day (over 159, 670 tons/year) of municipal solid waste (MSW), which is projected to increase to over 1,000 tons/day by 2030 (KMC 2023).Aligned with the strategic vision and targets of The Gambias Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), theproject will contribute to sustainable natural resource management through the promotion of adaptive management approaches as well as enhancing resilience of vulnerable communities and systems to climate and disaster risksthrough the provision of integrated and mutually reinforcing upstream and downstream livelihood support mechanisms and facilitating access to affordable and sustainable clean e"

The purpose of this Initiation Plan is to provide support the Government of the Republic of Moldova (the State Chancellery, as well as the Ministry of Finance) in implementing the PARS 2023-2030, particularly Objective V: Local public administration. A key aspect of this effort is to support launching and implementing the voluntary amalgamation process, demonstrating better and more equitable service provision and sustainable local development in the amalgamated communities. Additionally, UNDP’s Local Public Administration Reform Advisory Team (LPAR Advisory Team) will develop a comprehensive project proposal for further PARS support. This will ensure continuous progress, adaptability to new challenges, and the strengthening of local public authorities capacity for sustainable development and EU integration. The LPAR Advisory Team will also assist with other related policies, such as fiscal decentralization, and conduct regular monitoring and evaluation of the LPAR implementation."

      "On December 17, 2024, a powerful 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck near Port Vila, Vanuatu’s capital. Within 24 hours, a second 5.5 magnitude quake followed, triggering landslides and devastating infrastructure. Over 80,000 people have been affected, with many losing their homes and essential services. This disaster comes as communities are still recovering from twin cyclones in 2023, compounding the nation’s vulnerability.Vanuatu, home to over 300,000 people across 83 islands, faces frequent earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and extreme weather due to its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire. With limited infrastructure and economic resilience, disaster recovery remains a challenge.In response, UNDP has mobilized early recovery efforts since January, engaging in high-level coordination with government and humanitarian partners. As the Cluster Chair for Early Recovery under the Pacific Humanitarian Team, UNDP is spearheading a Housing and Building Damage Assessment initiative. This project aims to systematize reconstruction, strengthen local capacity, and enhance resilience, ensuring Vanuatu can better withstand future disasters."

      "There is a strong correlation between poverty and access to basic services and amenities. As part of Belize’s National Energy Policy (2023-2040), the country aims to provide “Universal access to basic services and improved access to modern services.’ Although 90% of Belize’s population has access to a reliable source of electricity many persons within rural communities across the country do not have access to modern forms of energy. In fact, of the 27 registered villages without access to electricity, 24 are found within the Toledo District alone. The “Rural Electrification using Microgrids in Southern Belize” project proposal was approved by the Board of Directors of India, Brazil and South Africa Facility for Poverty and Hunger Alleviation (IBSA Fund), and aims to address the critical needs of the marginalized communities within the 3 villages of Mabil-Ha, Otoxha, and Na Luum Caj in the Toledo District in Belize, for access to electricity. These communities face significant socioeconomic challenges, including a lack of access to electricity. Through this project, the Ministry of Rural Transformation, Community Development, Labour & Local Government of Belize (MRTCDLLG) seeks to improve the quality of life in these communities by providing solar panels, with charge controllers, battery banks and inverters, for electricity generation. This project will also contribute to, and build on, the work of the Ministry of Public Utilities, Energy, Logistics & E-Governance (MPUELE) as it relates to their “Rural Electrification Project” and will utilize female solar engineers who were trained by the Government of India via a South-South exchange programme. The main objective of this project is to promote rural electrification through isolated solar photovoltaic systems as a low-carbon and resilient development strategy for rural communities in Toledo, Belize."

To reduce the institutional, economic, cultural and mental barriers holding back the achievement of gender equality, a holistic approach is required, bringing the right partners, including government, civil society and the private sector together to make a maximum impact. The result is an institutional ecosystem that is more gender-transformative, empowered by capacity and knowledge, and better able to mainstream gender to achieve real result for women and men in Cambodia."
