      "LWOB will deliver TIP training to Liberian judges, lawyers, magistrates, and law enforcement personnel. It will produce and distribute illustrated graphic novels designed to convey complex legal concepts to potential victims of trafficking and to members of the legal community that are tailored to a Liberian context. These will be accompanied by trainer manuals that guide trainers through two (2) previously distributed graphic novels on the subject of TIPS and two newly created graphic novels under this grant. Law enforcement personnel will be provided with law enforcement \"toolkits\" that will provide law enforcement with critical practice tools in clear-cut and durable materials. The trainings are designed to promote the rule of law and will strengthen Liberia's overall capacity to identify, investigate, and successfully prosecute trafficking in persons cases. The trainings will be dual purposed to enable Liberians to practice in a non-TIPS context those skills that will be necessary to try a TIPS case, when it does present itself to prosecutors and the court. Focus will be on the discernible areas where stakeholders are misconstruing what are clearly human trafficking crimes and failing to prosecute (or successfully prosecute) TIPS scenarios under Liberia's 2005 Act to Ban Trafficking in Persons."
