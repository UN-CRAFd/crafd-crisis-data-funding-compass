The SHAPP will address as many basic needs as possible of the most vulnerable including child protection, support to victims or survivors of gender based violence, food, nutrition, water and sanitation. Human rights and international humanitarian law will remain at the centre of the new programme by informing and driving SHAPP design and priorities."
