      "Drug theft is one of the most common and lucrative forms of public corruption within the health sector of many developing countries. In addition to the growth-inhibiting and poverty-inducing effects that accompany corruption, drug theft slows the fight against preventable diseases like malaria and bacterial infection. In collaboration with the Drug Theft Investigations Unit at the Malawi Ministry of Health, we will experimentally evaluate whether top-down audits and bottom-up community monitoring can reduce drug theft. Additionally, we introduce a novel measurement protocol that uses radio and GPS tracking devices to measure rates of theft at different levels of the medications supply chain. This allows us to move beyond existing studies of corruption that focus on changes in corruption levels to present evidence demonstrating how anti-corruption interventions displace corruption to other parts of the system. Our project directly builds on existing anti-corruption priorities among development stakeholders in Malawi."

      "This project will provide the data, analyses, ideas and partnerships to accelerate the transition to a sustainable global trade system that reduces impacts on biodiversity and people, increases the social benefits of wildlife use and agricultural production, and fulfils the SDG's mission to �leave no-one behind�. This TRADE hub will develop new and long-overdue areas of cross-disciplinary science to analyse, understand, and increase the traceability and transparency of impacts for sub-national, national and global trade flows. It will, in parallel, and adopting a model of co-design, facilitate collaborations among research groups and private and public sector institutions working on trade within and across continents, and between Developing Countries and the UK. These collaborations will enhance the relevance, and promote the uptake, of our research, supporting decision-makers at all scales to develop and implement relevant policy and regulations. The scale of the challenge and time-frames associated with transitions in a complex trade system mean that large-scale impacts are only likely to be realised after the end of the hub. A key outcome will thus be to ensure that significant capacity and momentum is built across our partnership to continue the work on public policy and industry engagement well into the future."

      "Our project's overarching research question is: How do African societies design and implement climate action to improve sustainable livelihoods, and reduce both poverty and inequality? For example, all African countries need to adapt their food systems to be more resilient to climate change, but there are different routes to achieving this - such as investing in largescale industrialised agriculture or supporting small-scale farmers to be more climate smart - which can result in very different livelihood benefits across society.Our second objective is to build a network of African-UK researchers who can bring deep disciplinary expertise to bear on this interdisciplinary problem. In particular, our project brings together two newly-established ARUA Centres of Excellence (CoE) on climate change and inequalities, with world-leading expertise from the UK, to form this network and to work at the nexus of climate change, inequality and poverty"

The goal is to map the fragmentation of peacemaking and peacebuilding approaches and to assess to what extent non-Western approaches work in complementarity with Western statebuilding efforts, and to what extent they present a competing vision of peacemaking and peacebuilding that is in competition with more normative approaches to statebuilding. We aim to examine not just the alternative practices, but also provide an appraisal of whether and how these practices challenge the normative order developed in the aftermath of the Cold War, and underpinning peacebuilding practice since then. This mapping is a Phase One baseline study, across a range of case studies and domains, which could be built on if findings and funds permitted."

This presents a unique opportunity to learn. Building on a sample of 30,000 geo-referenced surveys conducted in Addis before the announcement, we will estimate both the direct effect of being relocated out of a dense city centre, as well as the externalities of the relocations, on labour markets in the surrounding areas. We will draw on a variety of empirical techniques from labour and urban economics to estimate how these spillover effects extend over space. In doing so will develop new methods for studying both treatment effects and externalities in dense urban labour markets, where labour markets are not defined by geographically distinct clusters."

      "Although researchers in development economics have made great progress in understanding the link between gender, jobs and poverty by rigorous evaluation of policies at a very micro level, aggregating this knowledge and assessing its external validity is still lagging behind. The data building activities within the G2LM-LIC project will address this challenge and facilitate the next stage of research on jobs and poverty by building the Global Jobs Database (GJD) which acts as a platform to harmonise all available micro datasets that contain information on labour market activities and poverty to create a multi-country macro data-set that contains, at a minimum: labor force participation, occupational choice (sector, casual vs regular, wage vs self-employment), earnings, hours worked, seasonality all by gender, ethnicity (where relevant), education, and wealth."

By combining detailed, monthly VAT micro-data from Ugandan and Rwandan firms between 2010 and 2021, this project will be the first to document how cross-border shocks affect the growth process via their impacts on domestic production networks."

Beyond the notable health impacts identified in the evaluation, we hypothesize that the program's benefits may extend significantly beyond its primary health focus. Specifically, we believe that communities where Community Health Assistants (CHAs) were recruited and stationed – as of the better health and higher job aspirations – might be more likely to have initiated a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop which we call \"Virtuous Cycle\"."

      "Drug theft is one of the most common and lucrative forms of public corruption within the health sector of many developing countries. In addition to the growth-inhibiting and poverty-inducing effects that accompany corruption, drug theft slows the fight against preventable diseases like malaria and bacterial infection. In collaboration with the Drug Theft Investigations Unit at the Malawi Ministry of Health, we will experimentally evaluate whether top-down audits and bottom-up community monitoring can reduce drug theft. Additionally, we introduce a novel measurement protocol that uses radio and GPS tracking devices to measure rates of theft at different levels of the medications supply chain. This allows us to move beyond existing studies of corruption that focus on changes in corruption levels to present evidence demonstrating how anti- corruption interventions displace corruption to other parts of the system.

      "This research aims to investigate the structure and functioning of evidence advisory systems (also called evidence ecosystems) serving to provide policy-relevant scientific evidence and advice to national government to inform health policy responses in Africa.\n\nThe research will be undertaken by Health Research Operations Kenya Limited, Makerere University School of Public Health Uganda, University of Global Health Equity Rwanda, The Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, London School of Economics & Political Science and Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine UK.\n\nThe research will take place in Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda and Uganda from March 2025 to February 2028. \n\nFor almost all aspects of health policy and planning, there is a need to inform policy decision with robust and policy appropriate evidence. It is therefore critically important for countries to build effective systems of evidence provision which can serve these needs. This is a particular challenge however for lower income settings, which may have limited capacity but which could benefit greatly from robust uses of scientific research, evidence, and innovation.  The team aims to work directly with local government stakeholders to co-produce research questions, establish locally-relevant normative conceptual frameworks of analysis, and ultimately coordinate activities which may lead to institutional improvements in evidence systems in Africa.",
      "The project has 4 objectives:\n\n1. Mapping national evidence advisory systems, institutional arrangements, and cultures of evidence in four case study countries: Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, and Uganda.\n2. Developing a framework on which to judge and evaluate the structure and function of national evidence advisory systems, co-produced with key stakeholders.\n3. Comparing national evidence advisory systems in relation to two contrasting health policy challenges (Universal Health Care and COVID-19).\n4. Development and monitoring of action plans for national stakeholders working to improve evidence systems for health."

      "Mental health conditions are the leading cause of disability among youth worldwide. These problems are more common\namong youth living in poverty. Mental health problems can have short- and long-term impacts on physical and mental\nhealth, education, employment and relationships. University students living in poverty have high rates of mental health\nproblems and limited support. These students face strong pressures to perform and succeed and to support their families.\nThese pressures also emerge during a life stage where there is greater potential to engage in risky behaviour, and\nincreased pressure for academic achievement - which can further increase risk of mental health problems.\nEffective support for vulnerable students could improve their mental health and future life chances. Most youth, however,\nreceive no care or support. In Brazil, around 80% of youth with mental health conditions receive no care and fewer receive\nevidence-based treatment. Although there is a great deal of evidence for effectiveness of psychotherapy (such as cognitive\nbehavioural therapy [CBT]) for preventing and treating youth mental health problems, lack of services and trained providers\nsignificantly limits access. Moreover, barriers such as transportation, cost and stigma further limit access. These barriers\nare greater for poor vs. non-poor youth. Use of digital interventions could improve access to care. They are lower cost and\ncould reduce stress on health systems and reach more users. They could also address stigma given they are more private.\nHowever, many digital interventions fail to engage users and sustain involvement. This limits their potential to improve the\nuser's mental health.\nThis research would test whether combining a digital mental health intervention with peer support and/or a conditional cash\ntransfer (CCT) (i.e., monetary incentive conditional on intervention participation) could increase participation and\nengagement among low-income university students. Research suggests CCTs can increase healthy behaviours and\npromote engagement by enabling students to purchase books and food, thereby avoiding food insecurity, reducing financial\nstress to enable focus on intervention, and reduce shame. Other research shows peer support can reduce stigma and\nincrease participation particularly among vulnerable populations.\nFirst, we would adapt and pilot a digital mental health intervention (e-CBT), shown to be effective among university\nstudents, in combination with CCT and/or peer support in collaboration with low-income university students. Following\nrefinement, we would see whether combining the e-CBT with: (1) CCT; (2) peer support or (3) CCT+peer support improves\nparticipation and engagement. We would use innovative methods to explore longer-term social and economic impacts of\nthe intervention in combination with CCT and peer support.",

      "Compared to children under 5, the needs of aged 5 to 14 years have been historically overlooked. Yet these children also face high levels of health-related challenges, caused or compounded by inadequate access to prevention and treatment, during a period critical for their development. When ill, school-age children are less likely than other age groups to seek treatment, and when they do, less likely to seek care from formal providers. In turn, lack of access of school-aged children to prevention and treatment has detrimental effects on a range of short- to long-term health, education, and economic outcomes. The World Health Organization recommends the implementation of comprehensive school health programmes (SHP), but these recommendations remain hardly implemented in low- and middle-income countries. Since 2015, an NGO called Healthy Learners (HL) has partnered with the government of Zambia to develop such a comprehensive SHP centred on the concept of \"School Health Workers\": a few teachers in each school trained and equipped to provide health education, coordinate the delivery of preventative services with clinics, and make preliminary diagnoses thanks to a tablet-based clinical decision tool, allowing them to refer severe cases to clinics, where learners receive priority treatment. This project aims to rigorously assess the impact of the SHP on a range of health and education outcomes and better understand the indirect effects of the program on teachers and clinics. We will rely on a cluster-randomised controlled trial, in six districts of the Copperbelt and Luapula provinces. 225 schools will be randomly selected and randomized to receive one of three interventions: (1) a comprehensive SHP (n=90 schools) corresponding to the full model developed by and implemented HL; (2) a limited range of school health activities (n=75) provided and implemented by the government, as per the current situation; (3) an enhanced range of health activities (n=60) where HL will support the government to ensure the reliable and regular provision of planned activities (mainly deworming and vitamin A). The study will draw on a range of methods and data sources. Implementation, uptake and cost of the program will be assessed through administrative data from the program itself, and qualitative interviews with members of the school communities. To assess the causal impact of the program on health and education outcomes, we will select 60 learners in each school, and conduct surveys before and 12 and 24 months after the start of the SHP, with objective health outcomes measured at endline. We will use pictorial health diaries to collect detailed and reliable data on illness spells and health-seeking behaviours. We will explore potential indirect effects on teachers through three school surveys and on clinics capacity, through health facility assessments. Finally, we will test if the program can lead to improved human capital accumulation in the longer-term, through positive changes in educational aspirations, well-being and sexual and reproductive health outcomes. The results of the study will contribute to the limited evidence base on school health programs in LMICs and will inform the scale-up of the SHP in Zambia and similar settings. The impact in Zambia will be facilitated by the strong links between the research team and the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education, who have been involved in the planning of the project. Finally, the project will also have a strong capacity-building component, through the participation of several young researchers (most of whom will be from Zambia) supported and mentored by the senior members of the team, and the organisation of training workshops in Zambia aiming to strengthen evaluation skills of members of all partner organisations.",

      "Epilepsy Pathway Innovation in Africa (EPInA) intervenes at four key points in the pathway from incidence to management of epilepsy over the entire life course and across segments of society. It proposes to reduce the burden of epilepsy by testing interventions in the following points: i) prevention; ii) diagnosis; iii) care; and iv) socio-economic burden. These studies are conducted in four sites across Africa: Accra, Zimbabwe, Ghana; Kilifi, Kenya; Mahenge, Tanzania; and the informal settlements of Nairobi, Kenya."

      "A UK and low- and middle-income country (LMIC) partnership that aims to improve the physical health of people with severe mental illness and the mental health of people with chronic physical conditions in LMICs.\rTAG( 1 )",
      "1) Improve health and reduce deaths associated with diabetes, heart and lung diseases in people with severe mental illness (SMI) by addressing the most common health risk behaviours identified by a physical health survey, assembling a cohort of people who can be approached for future research and by designing interventions aimed at changing health risk behaviours (tobacco, physical activity, alcohol and diet) based on a brief talking therapy. 2) Reduce depression and anxiety in people with chronic physical health conditions by integrating the detection and treatment of depression/anxiety into an intervention package for chronic diseases delivered in primary care. 3) Build research teams and capacity to secure competitive funding and delivery world class applied health research informing policy and practice in these areas.\r\rFollowing a costed extension, additional objectives will include:\rWork stream 1: Conduct workshops with a range of stakeholders to understand facilitators and barriers to integrating services for identifying and managing depression in tuberculosis (TB) and chronic hepatitis services.\r1. Train staff in TB and hepatitis services to identify depression and deliver treatment.\r2. Provide specialist supervision for non-mental health specialists in those settings.\r3. Release staff and other resources to help integrate depression care.\r4. Scale up and sustain integrated provision.\r5. Explore with patients the acceptability of routine depression case-finding and treatment within TB/ chronic hepatitis care and potential adverse outcomes of integration.\r\rWork stream 2: Run co-designed workshops with patients and healthcare staff to develop plans, pathways and materials for integrating depression care in TB and chronic hepatitis services.\r\rWork stream 3: Test feasibility of plans and materials for depression case-finding.\r1. Identify and train staff in exemplar sites to case find using standard instruments.\r2. Collect quantitative and qualitative data form audits, focus groups and individual interviews.\r3. Revise plans, materials, future intervention and trial design based on results.\r4. Develop new partnerships with National TB programmes and hepatitis services in partner countries.\r5. Continued capacity-strengthening and skill development for early career researchers."
