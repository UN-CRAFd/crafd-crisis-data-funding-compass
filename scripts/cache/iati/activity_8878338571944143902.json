      "The goal of the Development of Triple Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (DeTACT) project is to provide a solution using currently available antimalarials to contain multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria in the Greater Mekong Sub region, and to prevent the spread or emergence of resistance in India, Africa, and beyond. DeTACT aims to provide evidence from clinical, market and community-based research in support of a global change in policy to allow large-scale deployment of triple artemisinin-based combination therapies (TACTs) for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Switching from artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to TACTs could be one of the last available options using currently available drugs to treat multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria and prevent or delay it from spreading or emerging in areas where it is not yet present. The project is divided into seven work packages: (1) Develop two co-packaged TACTs for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. (2) Using these products, conduct randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trials in 13 sites in 8 African countries and 4 Asian countries to provide evidence of safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the TACTs. (3) Mathematical modelling to assess the potential of TACTs to delay the emergence and further spread of antimalarial drug resistance and the costs and benefits of introducing TACTs in countries with different levels of drug resistance, malaria transmission rates, and adherence to treatment guidelines. (4) Analyse the conceptual ethical aspects and conduct an empirical ethics/social science study addressing the ethical aspects of a change to TACTs in the African paediatric patient population.  (5) A market positioning assessment based on interviews and focus group discussions with stakeholders ranging from end users to national and regional policy makers, to address the barriers and strategies to overcome these, and acceptability of changing to TACTs in Asia and Africa, which present different epidemiological settings. (6) Effective communication of the design of the study and evidence generated in order to engage with key stakeholders at an early stage.(7) Conduct a meta-analysis on harmonised individual patient-level data to compare the efficacy, safety, tolerability of TACTs versus ACTs in the general study population and in sub-groups (e.g., malnourished or undernourished children)."

      "AMR is a global threat to public health and new technologies and integrated understanding of\rinformation on a local and global scale are required. Enhancing local decision making by providing\rhigh resolution data that can enhance treatment strategies to the individual is key to improving\rinfection control. Placing individuals and their data in the context of regional and national interpretation\rcan aid understanding of transmission, pathogen population dynamics and public health risk.\rUltimately, enhancing real time linkage of data at multiple geographic scales will provide us with a\rglobally aware data landscape and enhance our ability to spot the emergence and spread of new\rthreats and lead to intelligent deployment of interventions and the monitoring of their impact. Whole\rGenome Sequencing (WGS) is a technology increasingly embraced within translational public health\rcommunities and offers the ability to provide information at an individual level, as well as at a regional,\rnational and international scale due to its digital nature.\rBarriers to uptake of WGS are broad, practical and political, eg technology rollout, implementation and\rembedding in current practice as well as supply chains and reagent availability. Much progress is\rbeing made in technical support for practical implementation. However, a remaining major bottleneck\ris the rapid and routine linkage of data and interpretation to provide the greatest value to data\rgenerators at a local level, as well as the routine combination of data aggregated at a regional, national\rand international level.\rHere, we build upon work within the NIHR Global Health Research Unit on genomic surveillance of\rAMR focussed on technical support for practical rollout of WGS and expand and enhance through\rlinkage with regional institutions such as WHO to deliver regional capacity building. In addition, we\raddress the increasing emphasis and need for local data science and engineering to transform the\rdata landscape within local and regional hubs for linking clinical and epidemiological data to genomics.\rWe focus on operationalising methods and tools to deliver a data landscape for local and national, and\rultimately international monitoring of genomic trends in AMR linked to relevant clinical and\repidemiological data for enhancing infection control and taking decisive action to curb the threat of\rAMR;"

      "Understanding and mitigating resistance to effective treatment is a cornerstone of our fight against  infectious diseases. Antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacterial infections are increasingly predicted  to have catastrophic impact on global health and wellbeing. To better respond to this growing crisis, we need the highest quality insight into how, where and when AMR emerges and the ability  to monitor its progression so that we can understand whether our mitigation efforts are effective at a local, national and international level. \rWe have previously implemented capacity for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) at key  reference sites, embedded in nascent or existing national surveillance networks in Nigeria, India,  Colombia and The Philippines and shown the potential to enhance surveillance through outbreak  detection and monitoring of resistant populations. Saving lives demands rapid delivery of the right  data to the right decision makers. Transforming the data landscape to operationalise the use of  intelligent surveillance is key to moving from public health research to public health  implementation. Here we will: \r- Deliver a data and reporting landscape for WGS-enhanced surveillance. - Leapfrog a surveillance network in Nigeria to spot and stop outbreaks \r- Deliver stakeholder specific reporting pathways in The Philippines \r- Monitor the impact of interventions in India \r- Bring together surveillance for OneHealth in Colombia \r- Share and implement the above across Countries \r- Develop regional centres of excellence to drive international policy. \rWe will leave a legacy of engineering, data science and data driven surveillance enhanced through  the intelligent use of WGS. Effectively maximising the value of surveillance data to drive policy at  local, national and international levels will profoundly impact public health strategies for mitigating  the impact of antimicrobial resistant infections"

      "The AidConnect funded FoRBLN project aims to create a leadership network involving parliamentarians and belief leaders across eight countries to address the legislative barriers to FoRB and the social mores that support societal hostility towards minority groups on account of their religion or belief. This leadership network will be informed by research on both barrier-crossing leadership and an understanding of the likelihood these fragile states will descend into conflict. Training on FoRB issues will be delivered so that FoRB leaders (parliamentarians and belief leaders) can propose initiatives for their national or regional context and then providing them with the technical assistance and expertise to deliver such solutions. Best practice will be shared both within and across the regions. The regions / countries are; West Africa: The Gambia, Ghana and Sierra Leone. East Africa: Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda. South Asia: Bangladesh and Pakistan. This activity covers the publishing of a barriers-crossing leadership study, the publishing of historical and contemporary volatility indices, submission of a paper and an edited volume on the recent history of FoRB in the 8 fragile states and the management and support of the operational delivery by the main collaborator, the Church of England."

      "Aim(s) of the research Our aim is to improve quality-of-life for hip fracture patients and to reduce healthcare costs in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC) in Asia. Background to the research Older patients are particularly likely to break a bone (fracture) because of a fall from a standing height, as their bones are weakened by osteoporosis. These fragility fractures have serious consequences; in the UK 25% of hip fracture patients die within a year and survivors have a reduction in their quality-of-life similar to having a stroke. Outcomes may be even worse in LMIC without the same level of healthcare resource. Asia is particularly affected by rapidly ageing populations. The number of hip fractures is expected to increase from 1,124,060 now to 2,563,488 in 2050. Associated healthcare cost may rise to US$15 billion. Improving care for patients with hip fracture is therefore a priority in this region. Looking after patients following a hip fracture requires healthcare workers from many different backgrounds to work together. These include surgeons, doctors specialising in looking after older patients, nurses and therapists, each with defined roles and responsibilities. In the UK, this team approach has reduced the number of patients dying and improved quality-of-life after hip fracture. It also reduced time spent in hospital and associated healthcare costs . This study is about testing the benefits of such multidisciplinary care in LMIC in Asia. Design and methods The project will have two parts: 1. To refine the multidisciplinary HIPCARE training and support package for each LMIC. 2. To see if the HIPCARE intervention improves the quality-of-life for hip fracture patients in LMIC and whether it reduces healthcare costs, compared with usual care. The HIPCARE training package has three main components: early surgery to fix the hip fracture, early assessment by a medical doctor and early walking with the help of a therapist to speed recovery. Having refined the training materials to make HIPCARE specific to each country, we will do a large study to compare HIPCARE with usual care in 40 hospitals in LMIC. Community engagement This proposal has been developed together with members of the Global Health Fragility Fractures Community Engagement and Involvement Panel with support from the World Musculoskeletal Trauma Patient and Public Involvement Group. The views of patients and their carers, from Asia and the UK, informed all aspects of the study but in particular the choice of eligibility criteria, primary outcome measure and follow-up plan. Dissemination We disseminate the findings of this study: 1. Through plain language summaries specific to each country via social media/web-pages as well as hard-copy 2. Through our partnership with the Global Fragility Fracture Network, with its many events worldwide 3. Through scientific publications and presentations"

      "Research Question What are effective, sustainable, and cost-effective strategies that target the causes and consequences of child injuries in Tanzania and Zimbabwe?Background Child injuries are a leading cause of death and disability globally. They cause a loss of economic productivity at individual, family, societal, and national levels, lead to catastrophic health expenditures, and impose a significant burden on healthcare systems. With simple, cost-effective interventions, many child injuries are preventable. However, a lack of reliable data on injury prevalence, care processes, and outcomes has hindered evidence-based policymaking in Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Our research programme aims to bridge this gap and contribute to national efforts to reduce child mortality and morbidity from injury. Tanzania and Zimbabwe have been chosen as research locations due to their high incidence of child injuries, modelled at 8.087 and 6.804 per 1000 person-years respectively, and their government’s commitment to reducing child mortality and morbidity from injury by 2030. Our research programme will address the World Health Organization’s World Report on Child Injury Prevention recommendations: 1) enhance the quality and quantity of data for child injury prevention, 2) research on the causes, consequences, costs, and prevention of child injuries, 3) implement specific actions to prevent and control child injuries, and 4) strengthen health systems to address child injuries. Aims and Objectives1) Assess the burden and determinants of child injuries across age groups, socio-demographic categories, and geographic regions; 2) Develop, implement, and evaluate cost-effective strategies for child injury prevention with scale-up across communities; 3) Determine the cost of service delivery across referral and district networks to guide evidence-based resource allocation; and 4) Develop, implement, and evaluate a sustainable community-led capacity building programme to improve child injury care.Methods We will employ a mixed-methods approach, using qualitative and quantitative methodologies for patient-level and health economic analyses. Our research will be guided by Complex Systems Theory and the Systems-Within-Systems Framework, acknowledging the interconnected nature of childhood trauma and the bidirectional influence between children and the broader systems they are embedded in.Anticipated impact and disseminationAligned with in-country child health improvement priorities, our research anticipates reducing child injury incidence and enhancing trauma care skills among clinicians, ultimately improving children's health. Findings will be disseminated through publications in public health, policy, and clinical journals and presentations at academic meetings. Policymakers will be equipped with comprehensive reports and policy briefs for informed decision-making. Healthcare practitioners will gain toolkits and health economic data for effective service delivery. The public will be engaged via various media outlets and advocacy groups, promoting awareness and safety practices. We foresee our programme influencing broader health systems and economic productivity, creating a ripple effect of benefits."

      "Outline:A UK and low-and middle-income country (LMIC) research partnership that aims to develop and evaluate a community pharmacy-based intervention to improve hypertension management among low-income urban residents in Bangladesh and Pakistan. By delivering hypertension care through community pharmacies, the team seeks to enhance access to care and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases(CVDs). CVDs are the leading cause of death globally, and hypertension is The most significant modifiable risk factor for CVDs. In Bangladesh And Pakistan, a high percentage of individuals with hypertension remain undiagnosed, untreated, or have uncontrolled blood pressure, particularly among low-income urban residents who face significant barriers to accessing healthcare. Community pharmacies are widely accessible and frequently used by these populations but are not fully integrated into formal healthcare systems. The long-term aim of the award is to reduce premature deaths and disabilities caused by hypertension and associated CVDs in Bangladesh and Pakistan. This intervention will enable community Pharmacists to provide hypertension care, including blood pressure monitoring, medication adherence support, health education, and referrals to primary care physicians. Commencing in March 2025, the award will map existing community pharmacies and engage with key stakeholders to understand the current practices and identify barriers and facilitators regarding the implementation of the intervention. The intervention will be tested via a feasibility study before undertaking a randomised control trial to assess the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the intervention in reducing systolic blood pressure.The award has nine objectives: 1. Develop a context-specific intervention aimed at managing hypertension among low-income urban residents in Bangladesh and Pakistan through community pharmacies. 2. Explore the feasibility of delivering the intervention and refine methods and procedures for a large-scale trial. 3.Assesstheeffectivenessof the intervention in reducing systolic bloodpressureamonglow-incomeurbanresidentsaged30years and older with hypertension in Bangladesh and Pakistan. 4.Conductacomprehensiveprocessevaluationtounderstandthe implementation process of the intervention and how the health system and urban context in each site influence its effectiveness and sustainability. 5.Developacost-effectivenessmodel for hypertension care and assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention, including the costs of scaling up and the value of investing in strategies to improve uptake. 6.

      "Injuries are the leading cause of death in people aged 10-49 years. More people die from injuries than from HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis combined. For every person who dies, up to 50 people survive but become disabled. Broken bones account for most of these injuries, and these happen more often to people living in poor regions, including some countries in Africa. Across Africa, little is known about how many people break a bone, what healthcare services are available to treat them, how a broken bone affects patients/families, and how to improve recovery.Our project has four parts:(1) RESEARCH TRAINING AND RESOURCES: Doctors, nurses and healthcare workers involved in the care of patients with broken bones have limited training in how to conduct research, and have poor access to the resources to do research. This makes it more difficult to improve the care for their patients. We will look at the current levels of research training and organization. We will design educational resources to fill gaps in the current understanding and ability to do research. (2) COUNTING BROKEN BONES: We will create a network of hospitals in our partner countries to study how often different types of broken bones occur. We will describe the resources (people and equipment) available to treat these injuries and how patients use these services. We collect this information for five broken bones that the World Health Organization (WHO) have identified to cause the most disability. (3) UNDERSTANDING RECOVERY: We will find out how patients in our partner countries recover from their broken bones, and how this impacts on their livelihoods and those who care for them. (4) STUDY FOR FUTURE RESEARCH: We want to understand how to do large-scale research for patients with broken bones throughout Africa. To do this we will run a small study in our network of hospitals to see what works well and what is challenging. This project will help us understand the number of broken bones that happen in Africa and what treatments are available to patients. It will develop research teams and guide us for future research studies. This works towards our vision that the care for broken bones in poor countries can be safe, accessible, and appropriate to the resources of local health systems. Community engagement and involvement: We have engaged with local patients and healthcare workers, whose opinions have informed our work so far. We will continue to integrate patients and community leaders to co-produce our research.Dissemination: Patients, clinicians and methodologists will co-develop publications, social media, and events. We will work alongside policy makers in national government ministries and strengthen our relationship with leaders within the WHO to ensure that we disseminate our findings effectively and influence policy to drive improved patient care.",
      "Across three African countries (Malawi, South Africa and Tanzania) we plan to: (1) develop the ability to research the care of people with broken bones, (2) determine the number of people affected by broken bones, (3) describe the healthcare resources available for the treatment of broken bones and work out what is important for the best delivery of services, (4) measure how a broken bone impacts the lives and livelihoods of patients and their carers, and (5) improve the recovery of patients with broken bones."

      "Dengue and other viruses transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti are a growing problem in West Africa with increasingly frequent outbreaks. Control of the mosquito is the most effective way to protect humans. This project, which will run from 2024 to 2028 is based in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso where regular dengue epidemics have occurred in recent years. To carry out the research project, we have formed a collaboration between Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM, UK), Université Joseph Ki-Zerbo (Burkina Faso) Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Santé – Direction Régionale de l'Ouest (Burkina Faso), Spanish National Research Council (Spain), Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (France), University of Glasgow (UK) and King's College London (UK). We propose to develop a community-based approach for arbovirus outbreak prevention and response. We will collect data on the abundance and distribution of Aedes aegypti in different environments, their genetics and behaviour, human exposure to bites and circulating virus levels to model the forces governing dengue dynamics and develop an improved index for virus transmission risk. Additional work will test the effectiveness of digital surveillance of mosquitoes using a mobile app to determine a potential role for citizen science. Trials will be conducted of different tools to control mosquito adults and immatures, including a large-scale community-embedded programme to determine the effectiveness of reducing mosquito breeding sources. Capacity building is embedded throughout, with the aim of developing skills in trial design and analysis, social science, community-based programme development and implementation, genetic diagnostics and genomics, serosurveillance, entomology and statistics/modelling. Community engagement and involvement activities will play a crucial role throughout the project activities and have a dedicated work package supported by researchers based both in Burkina Faso and in northern partner institutes. We believe that new evidence on arbovirus epidemiology in sub-Saharan Africa and a new generation of local specialists is urgently needed to fill the skills gaps from the bottom upwards and to equip African health systems with the experience, knowledge, and motivation to respond effectively to arbovirus outbreaks.",
      "1. Development of improved indices for estimating arbovirus transmission risk by integrated modelling of adult Aedes aegypti abundance, distribution and behaviour, genomic admixture, environmental covariables, human behaviour, immunological biomarkers and mosquito biting patterns2. Implementation of community-based surveillance for immature mosquito development sites, adult occurrence and biting perceptions using the Mosquito Alert mobile app, cross-validated via entomological monitoring of adults and larval sites and bite biomarkers3. Community-embedded implementation of interventions including (i) a large-scale cluster randomised control trial of larval source management, and (ii) a stepwise-phased suite of adult-targeted interventions, suited to local Ae. aegypti bionomics, leading to a household-level randomised control trial of the most promising4. Capacity development of researchers from Burkina Faso extended to West Africa via PhD topics embedded within all project activities and outreach activities to the wider West African research and vector control community5.

      "Evaluation and Transfer of mobile whole slide tissue scanners and liquid\rbiopsies to deliver fast and precise diagnosis for improved outcomes of children and young adults with EBV-driven lymphoma: a joint Tanzanian and Ugandan\rPaediatric Oncology Network Initiative",
      "Summary:\r\rSub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is facing a major public health challenge from non-communicable diseases. The\rdisease burden attributable to cancer is rapidly rising, with a predicted 85% increase in incidence by\r2030. In a region where 40% of the entire population is under the age of 15, cancer is more likely to\rpresent in younger patients in sub-Saharan Africa, evidenced by a rising paediatric/adolescent\rincidence.\r\rAggressive lymphoma accounts for nearly 10% of all cancer diagnosis in the region, due to a strong\rassociation with Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection(5,7,8). Despite established diagnostic pathways,\rtreatments and improving outcomes in developed countries, diagnostics, treatment and support are\rseverely limited in SSA and outcomes poor(2,9,10). Tissue diagnosis in particular poses a significant challenge with a single pathologist being responsible for millions of patients within a region(9).\r\rFurthermore, there are significant practical challenges to obtaining tumour tissue from children.\rWith the availability of digital pathology and low-cost peripheral blood DNA analysis, we now have\rthe potential to rapidly and accurately screen, diagnose and monitor children and young adults with\rEBV associated lymphoma (EBVL) without the specific need for tissue biopsy. We already have\rpreliminary results from our laboratory demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity of this method\rfor lymphoma diagnosis(11).\r\rThis liquid biopsy only requires an additional 4-10ml (1-3 teaspoons) of peripheral venous blood collected\rinto a specified blood tube. Given that all patients currently have standard of care (SOC) testing, including\rroutine blood tests and often an insertion of a long-term venous access line, this additional sample poses\rminimal if any risk to the patient.\r\rOur proposal also aims to address issues surrounding pathological diagnosis. Currently in East Africa,\ra single pathologist is responsible for 3.2m patients. Thus, despite tissue biopsy remaining as the gold\rstandard diagnostic test, a major hurdle to diagnosis is obtaining a result in a timely manner. Samples\rare often transported overseas for reporting in large established tertiary labs.\r\rWe will therefore assess the utility of a digital microscopy platform which we are already using for teaching\rand training in the region. This technology will enable local scientists of obtain diagnostic quality digital\rimages of traditional histopathology glass slides that can be shared immediately for reporting.\rIn collaboration with our partners across SSA, we will assess the accuracy of these two low cost novel\rtechnologies for diagnosing EBVL in East African patients aged 5 to 21 suspected of having the condition.\rTechnology 1: Liquid biopsy – detection of fragments of lymphoma specific DNA shed into the peripheral\rblood from tumours. Also known as circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA). Testing requires collection of 10ml\r(2 teaspoons) or peripheral blood. We already have pilot data in an Oxford cohort of lymphoma patients\rthat demonstrates a high sensitivity and specificity for ctDNA as a diagnostic tool.\r\rTechnology 2: Mobile digital microscopy – device that can reproduce high-resolution, diagnostic\rquality, whole slide digital images from blood smears and tissue biopsy slides.\rAim: to improve diagnosis of childhood lymphoma in sub-Saharan Africa by making it faster and more\rprecise using mobile digital pathology devices and liquid biopsy\r\rObjectives\r1. Assess the diagnostic accuracy of liquid biopsy testing\r2. Asses the diagnostic accuracy of digital pathology\r3. Development of a digital pathology machine learning algorithm\r4. Transfer of above novel tests and associated expertise to local laboratories\rPatients Children and adolescents aged 3 to 30 suspected of having EBVL.\r\rDesign\rRetrospective Case control study.\r\rMethod\rAll patients recruited will continue to have routine local standard of care testing.\rWe will compare the two technologies against current local ‘gold standard’ tests for diagnosing EBVL.\r- Gold Standard tissue glass slide light-microscopy versus liquid biopsy (single blood test, 4-10ml at study\rentry)\r- Gold Standard tissue glass slide light-microscopy versus whole slide digital images (WSI)\rThe results of the novel tests will be analysed retrospectively, therefore therapeutic decisions will only be\rmade based upon the gold standard test results.\r\rProvided we observe a strong correlation between WSI, ctDNA and the gold standard test, we will plan to\rproceed to a second study where we will assess the time-to-diagnosis for these three methods."

      "Vaccination is a hugely important public health intervention: key to smallpox eradication, polio\r\nelimination, and control of Ebola outbreaks and the COVID-19 pandemic. But not everyone benefits\r\nequally. Some vaccines give weaker protection in people from rural, tropical settings than in those from high income settings: for example, BCG for tuberculosis and oral polio vaccine for polio. Some new vaccines, under development, also elicit weaker responses in people living in low-income, rural\r\nsettings. The biological reasons for this are not fully understood. Also, some people benefit less from\r\nvaccines for socioeconomic reasons, such as the social context of the communities they live in,\r\nincluding limited access to accurate information to aid vaccine choices. Social and biological factors\r\ncan interact to make communities “vulnerable” in terms of vaccine impact. For example, poor people in rural communities with difficulties in vaccine access may also be undernourished or exposed to\r\ninfections that alter immune responses to vaccination. This needs to be addressed to promote health\r\nequity, but also to secure maximum global benefit from vaccines: non-immune communities are foci for recurrent disease outbreaks.\r\n\r\nVAnguard’s goal is to understand how biological and social factors interact to impair vaccine impact in\r\nvulnerable African communities, in order to develop integrated strategies to optimise vaccine benefits\r\nand drive health equity.\r\n\r\nVAnguard will bring together African and UK experts in vaccine research, implementation and\r\nstakeholder and community engagement, to work in Uganda and Kenya to\r\n\r\n1. Investigate how biological factors (such as infections, nutrition) influence vaccine responses\r\n2. Explore how communities perceive and access vaccines, what influences them to take up\r\nvaccines for themselves and their families, and how this relates to social vulnerability, biological health status and vaccine information\r\n3. Bring together biological and social data, and engage communities, to work out how\r\nvaccination can best be optimised for vulnerable communities, thereby also benefitting entire\r\npopulations.\r\n\r\nFirst, we shall work with national stakeholders (such as Ministries of Health, and vaccine-related nongovernmental organisations), review literature, and work on samples from previous studies, to identify Ugandan and Kenyan communities likely to have most difficulty in getting the best out of vaccination programmes (“vulnerable communities”). Then, with stakeholders and communities, we shall co-design the VAnguard Community Study, and implement it to investigate in detail which biological and social factors most influence vaccine impact in vulnerable communities. Data and economic modellers will study the results to identify which factors could usefully be modified, and we shall work with the communities to explore ways in which this could be done. Hence we shall co-develop strategies which national stakeholders may be able to implement straight away, or which can be tested in future studies.\r\n\r\nThe work will be led by young African scientists, supported by local and international experts, to build\r\ncapacity for African vaccine research. Biological, social, and implementation scientists and experts will work closely together to understand each other’s disciplines, establishing a culture of collaboration that will foster sustainable pathways to the desired impact: healthy communities."

This is a grant to the University of Oxford, working in collaboration with the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, to strengthen the evidence base on the current global burden of AMR, and help us to understand how, where and why it is changing. The Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance (GRAM) Project is providing the essential health intelligence to help drive awareness, support better surveillance, and prompt policy action to control AMR, including facilitating antimicrobial stewardship. The Fleming Fund grant specifically supports the collection and synthesis of data on the burden of disease associated with AMR in LMICs and is working to ensure that AMR is included within the Global Burden of Disease study. This project was not put out to an open, competitive tender process because IHME is the only organisation in the world with the computing power required for AMR geospatial mapping, which means they are the only institution capable of mapping the global burden of AMR into the global burden of disease. IHME is also the only institution currently mapping the global burden of disease, though the resulting information is open source access. IHME has chosen the University of Oxford as a supplier of data and is under no obligation to grant access to their computing power to another organisation."

      "The Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) programme has made substantial progress in understanding the African climate and has developed methodologies to evaluate the regional climate processes and impact-relevant indices which matter locally. As part of the FCFA Accountable Grant funded by the UK Government's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), previously referred to as the Department for International Development (DfID) (IATI identifier GB-1-203835-107), the LaunchPAD project was initiated as one of the three key outputs to continue the legacy of the broader FCFA programme (IATI identifier GB-1-203835-102). The LaunchPAD is the first phase of the Climate Model Evaluation Hub for Africa and has been established to build upon the novel science findings and methods to extend the work to more regions and systems, and to embed tools into automated software that will fast-track the understanding of how well climate models simulate climate dynamics in African regions. The establishment of the Hub was made possible by building on existing FCFA research networks through researchers at the University of Oxford, University of Yaounde I, University of Nairobi, University of Cape Town, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, and the Met Office, showcasing the strong legacy and importance of FCFA partnerships between British and African research institutions.",
      "SouthSouthNorth, as the holder of the Accountable Grant, oversees the management the LaunchPAD. Oxford University is the lead implementing partner, contracting individuals from other institutions to work on the project. Due to the qualitative nature of this activity, all reporting is done through the submission of quarterly reports, rather than using IATI's quantitative submissions. This activity is referred to under Output 1 in the reporting."

This pilot project in Vietnam: 1) Developed an AMR reference laboratory, including setting up the required infrastructure and recruitment and training of a surveillance team and; 2) Developed a national AMR surveillance programme. As a result of this work, Vietnam has developed its first stage of laboratory infrastructure at the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases in Hanoi. Equipment has been installed, staff recruited and trained, and surveillance networks strengthened. The pilot project has now ended but there is a Fleming Fund country grant in Vietnam that is overseen by the Fleming Fund management agent as part of the ‘Fleming Fund - Country and Regional Grants and Fellowships Programme’ GB-GOV-10-FF_MA."

      "Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases to affect humankind. It kills around half a million people, mostly young children in Africa. It also places a huge disease burden on large parts of the world, leading to hundreds of millions of serious infections. As well as directly causing suffering and death, this limits the development of large parts of the globe, reducing productivity and maintaining inequality.  Malaria is caused by a tiny, single celled parasite, known as Plasmodium. An individual contracts malaria when bitten by an infected mosquito. The parasites are injected into the blood stream as the mosquito feeds. These first develop and divide within the liver without causing disease. They next emerge from the liver and infect red blood cells, replicating and increasing in number and driving the symptoms of malaria. At the same time, a fraction of the parasites within the blood take a different developmental route, adopting a form known as the gametocytes. When a mosquito takes a blood meal from an infected person, they are likely to ingest some of these gametocytes. Within the midgut of the mosquito these develop into male and female gametes, and fuse together. This completes the infection cycle and the parasites move to the salivary glands of the mosquito, ready to be injected into another human victim.  Development of a vaccine to prevent malaria has proved very challenging and it is likely that the vaccines of the future will simultaneously target multiple stages of the parasite life cycle, blocking both liver and blood cell entry. One component of such a vaccine is likely to target the gametes of the parasite and to stop them from fusing. This is known as a transmission-blocking vaccine component as it will prevent the development of the parasite within the mosquito and will therefore stop the disease from being passed from person to person through the action of this blood-sucking insect.   We study a molecule called Pfs48/45 that is found on the surface of the gametocytes and gametes of Plasmodium parasites. Pfs48/45 is essential for a male gamete to fuse with a female gamete and if the immune system of an animal is exposed to Pfs48/45, it produces molecules called antibodies that bind to Pfs48/45 and prevent gametes from fusing. This means that if we can include Pfs48/45 in a vaccine, it will trigger the human body to make antibodies that will prevent malaria from being transmitted to other people. This will reduce the prevalence of malaria in the community and will help to eradicate the disease.  Despite this promise, Pfs48/45 is a challenging molecule to produce in a functional form and in large quantities. In addition, if we are to make vaccines that simultaneously contain multiple components, it will be important for each component to be as small and focused as possible, to make it easier and cheaper for them to be produced and distributed. For this reason we aim to understand the structure and shape of Pfs48/45 and also to understand the location and the nature of the sites where the gamete-fusion-preventing antibodies bind. This information will allow us to use the latest computational tools to design novel molecules which contain just the regions of Pfs48/45 that are needed to bind to inhibitory antibodies.  We will then inject mice with these novel immunogens and study the antibodies that are produced in a mosquito-infection experiment. If mosquitoes are fed on human blood containing malaria parasites, gametes can fuse, leading to the formation of cysts in the gut wall of the mosquito. If gamete fusion is prevented, the cysts are no longer formed. We will therefore study the ability of the antibodies induced by our novel immunogens to prevent cyst formation revealing which of our designs is most effective at blocking gamete fusion and preventing transmission of the malaria parasite. These newly designed molecules will form part of the malaria vaccines of the future.",

      "Between 2000 and 2010, worldwide antibiotic consumption increased by 35%, including large rises in the use of antibiotic drugs used as a last-resort, when other treatments fail. This rise was particularly apparent in middle income countries, with growing populations and increasing access to antibiotics. Rising levels of antibiotic consumption are associated high levels of antibiotic resistance, and increasing numbers of bacterial infections that are difficult or impossible to treat with antibiotics. Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use has been shown to reduce the level of antibiotic resistance at population-level in high income countries, but few population-level interventions aiming to reduce antibiotic use have been evaluated in low and middle income countries with higher burdens of infectious disease and antibiotic resistance.  This development grant will inform the design of two community-based interventions aiming to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use and related antibiotic resistance. One intervention will target the supply of antibiotics through private pharmacies, the major source of treatment for minor illness, and where antibiotics can easily be obtained without a prescription. Introducing a rapid diagnostic test in this setting would help pharmacists to differentiate between people with non-bacterial infections that do not require antibiotics, and those with likely bacterial infections that should be referred to a health professional. The other intervention will tackle the demand for antibiotics in communities by using participatory discussion in groups to improve understanding of the problem of antibiotic resistance, and develop appropriate strategies to address it in their community.   To assist intervention development, we will conduct a review of the literature to learn from other successful approaches using rapid diagnostic tests outside the formal healthcare system, and health behaviour change interventions in communities. We will collect information from providers and consumers of antibiotics in communities, to understand what drives inappropriate use, and we will also explore their views about the introduction of rapid diagnostic tests in pharmacies, and what price would be attractive for both. We will work with community members, using visual media to develop materials and messages that can be used to talk about antibiotic resistance with other communities.  On finalising the design of the interventions, a methodology will be developed to evaluate and understand the effect of these interventions, with input from experts and local partners. Funding sources will be identified to implement the interventions and research the effect of community-based interventions on antibiotic use and resistance in rural Vietnam. We will disseminate our learning from this process through international peer reviewed publications, briefing papers, and discussions with local partners and community participants.",

      "Air pollution is an important cause of ill-health worldwide. This is particularly the case in China and many other developing countries, in which outdoor air pollution is worsening due to increased traffic and industrial activities. Furthermore, many people still use solid fuels (e.g. wood, charcoal or coal) for cooking and heating in rural areas, generating harmful smoke and other toxic substances inside the home. Although we know that air pollution causes death and illness at the population level, the exact extent is not fully understood because accurate information is lacking. Reliable estimation of the disease risks arising from air pollution requires measurements of individual exposures to air pollution and their subsequent disease outcomes (i.e. onset of new diseases and death). We propose to address this knowledge gap using the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB), a large study of 500,000 men and women recruited from 10 diverse urban and rural areas in China in 2004-08 with detailed tracking of disease outcomes as a resource to study the health effects of air pollution. This represents an efficient approach that avoids the need to generate a separate expensive study to conduct this work.   Use of CKB in this way requires improvements to existing air pollution data. As in many other large scale epidemiological studies, CKB did not directly measure actual air pollution levels individually, but relied on participants to report information on the type of fuel they use for cooking or heating and how often, or how close to a main road they live. Since individuals spend a varying amount of time in different locations doing various activities, this may be inaccurate measure of individual air pollution. The ideal would be to measure in real time the pollutant concentrations in the air breathed by each person individually. However, this will be impractical in a study of 0.5 million participants, so the challenge is to achieve estimates of exposure in a cost-effective manner. This proposal represents a pilot project to test and assess different methods of measuring individual exposure to household and ambient air pollution.  In this project we will ask 300 CKB participants from 2 rural and 1 urban regions to carry a small wearable monitor with them to record particle pollutant concentration for two 5 day periods in both warm and cool seasons of the year. In addition, we will ask them to note what activity (e.g. cooking, commuting) they are doing, the duration and the location, so that we can understand how much of their pollution exposure comes from indoor or outdoor environments. Because it could be difficult and expensive to ask each participant to wear a monitor, we will also test whether it is sufficient to estimate individual air pollution by using data from ground monitoring networks, supplemented by satellite remote sensing technology. Two of the many satellites orbiting Earth carry sensors that detect infrared light transmitted through the atmosphere, providing a measure of airborne particulate matter. Using information from satellites and ground monitors, we will create a more complete map of air pollution. We will test and optimise this new approach in Suzhou, an urban CKB site that already has good coverage of ground-based pollution monitoring data. Based on the residential addresses of study participants, we can use this air pollution map to estimate an individual's ambient exposure level. We will use this information to carry out an analysis to investigate the health effects of air pollution in Suzhou participants.   This proposal will provide important new understanding and experience needed to plan a larger project involving all 0.5 million participants in CKB. Ultimately we aim to collect reliable exposure and disease outcome data to accurately understand the impact of air pollution on health in China.",

      "Injuries are a leading cause of death among children around the world. Globally, nearly 650,000 children under the age of 15 lose their lives every year to injuries and violence. This burden is unequally distributed between low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) and high-income countries (HIC) with the mortality rate from unintentional injuries in LMICs being nearly double that of HICs. In particular, Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest proportion of under 5 deaths in the world.  More than 70% of these injuries are non-transport unintentional or \"accidental\" injuries. Evidence shows that a large proportion of childhood unintentional injuries take place in and around the home, where children are generally believed to be well supervised. Children, especially those under 5 years, spend a significant amount of their time in and around the home which exposes them to various injury hazards e.g. stairs and windows without safety grills, access to poisonous substances and chemicals, areas of open water, access to ground level stoves.  Despite an overall global reduction in child injury mortality rates over the past two decades, available data indicates that the rate of decline has been much slower in LMICs and the gap between LMICs and HICs is widening. This is due in part to higher risks, inadequate preventive measures and a lack of access to timely medical care in LMICs. The nature of household injuries among children has been well documented in HICs but much less is known in LMICs. Much of what is known about preventing child injuries in the home stems from research conducted in HICs where preventive measures have been shown to be effective e.g. safety caps, smoke alarms, stair gates coupled with education of parents/carers. What is not known is how effective these measures would be in LMICs.  This study aims to test the effectiveness of a child safety kit (developed through co-design to reflect differing risk profiles, cultural appropriateness and availability/affordability) against traditional education. The study will be carried out in Jinja, Uganda and will involve two phases: Phase 1 (the focus of this development grant, conducted over 1 year) will focus on contextualizing the child injury problem and developing the child safety kit through mixed methods (a review of hospital data, focus groups with parents/carers, in-depth interviews with key informants, an affordability/availability survey and a market survey to ascertain willingness to pay for safety equipment); and Phase 2 which will measure behaviour change and reductions in injuries through a cluster Randomised Control Trial (cRCT). We will assess the reduction in child injuries in two villages (clusters) - one which will have the full child safety kit of equipment plus educational material, workshops and awareness campaign for parents versus the other cluster with only education - over 3 years.  A key component of Phase 1 will be to support collaborative research between scientific researchers, policy makers and parents such that all stakeholders involved in the health of under 5's have the opportunity to be full participants from conceptualisation to communication of results. The co-design approach will result in the development of a holistic intervention to include the child safety kit, educational material, training workshops for parents and a community-based awareness campaign. Engaging the community from the beginning will result in improved knowledge and awareness through the sharing of opinions and experience and will optimise equipment usage during Phase 2.   The results of Phase 1 will identify any challenges to implementing the intervention, provide accurate data on which to calculate sample sizes for the cRCT and determine the key outcomes. To our knowledge, this will be the first cRCT on child safety equipment and education conducted in Africa.",

      "Nontyphoidal strains of Salmonella are a major cause of fatal bloodstream infection in Africa, particularly among young children and people living with HIV/AIDS. These Salmonella infections are difficult to diagnose and antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem, so an effective vaccine against nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) has the potential to save many lives. Vaccines currently in development against NTS aim to work by stimulating the production of antibodies to a sugar known as O-antigen which is part of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecule and found on the Salmonella surface. My previous research has shown that some HIV-infected adults in Africa have very high levels of these antibodies which then block killing of the Salmonella bacteria. Hence there is a risk that these vaccines may cause harm to people with HIV.  This project aims to understand the basis for susceptibility to NTS bloodstream infections in HIV-infected Africans, and in particular to understand the phenomenon of blocking antibodies, with a view to designing improved vaccines that will protect HIV-infected groups against NTS. I hypothesise that NTS is present at increased levels in the gut in HIV infection and that because the gut wall does not function properly in these patients, the Salmonella bacteria are able to invade the bloodstream. Here they can go on to cause severe disease and death due to the inability of the immune system to kill these bacteria, because of the presence of blocking levels of antibodies. I hypothesise that the continual movement of Salmonella and Salmonella LPS into the circulation drives the production of these high levels of blocking antibodies, because antibody production is no longer appropriately regulated in HIV infection.  I will test this hypothesis in a group of adults newly-diagnosed with HIV infection in Uganda, studying them for two years after they commence antiretroviral therapy (ART) and comparing them with HIV-uninfected subjects. Incidence of NTS bloodstream infections initially rises when starting ART and then falls, but remains much higher than in HIV-uninfected subjects. Therefore, looking at specific immune parameters with time on ART will help understand which are most relevant to susceptibility to NTS infection. Since compromise of the barrier state of the gut is key to my hypothesis, I will study samples of gut tissue taken at endoscopy, as well as peripheral blood.  First, I will test to see whether NTS is present in the gut of HIV-infected participants and whether it occurs more frequently and at higher levels than in HIV-uninfected controls. Then I will investigate the transfer of Salmonella from the gut to the bloodstream and compare this with the immune status of the gut wall, seeing whether this transfer is associated with loss of particular groups of immune cells known as Th17 and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. Finally, I will study the levels and function of antibodies targeting LPS O-antigen, to determine whether they block or kill Salmonella, comparing them with antibodies to a protein known as flagellin which is also present on the Salmonella surface. I will test whether levels and function of these antibodies associate with changes in the numbers and function of two further groups of immune cells, Tfh and Treg cells, which are infected by HIV and which regulate antibody production.  I will follow changes in these immune parameters in the group of HIV-infected participants over time on ART, and look for associations at time points with known differences in susceptibility to NTS. This will enable me to better understand which factors are most relevant for susceptibility to NTS, the mechanism of susceptibility and production of blocking antibodies, and what vaccine or other therapeutic strategies might best protect HIV-infected populations against NTS.",

      "Pathology is the science of the causes and effects of diseases, especially the branch of medicine that deals with the laboratory examination of samples of body tissue for diagnostic or forensic purposes that have been obtained from an affected part of the body while the patient is alive (biopsy) or dead (necropsy or autopsy). In medicine, pathologic examination of tissues from patients who have died can be helpful to establish the cause of death. Knowledge of cause of death is of importance for prioritizing and distribution of public health resources. In Vietnam pathology is not part of routine diagnostics of patients and is not routinely used to establish cause of death. Knowledge of cause of death in Vietnam is therefore limited, also due to limited diagnostic capacity and inadequate national recording and reporting systems. In infectious diseases, which are the cause of death of around 10-15% of all people who die, the cause of death is only known in a minority of cases.  In the proposed project we aim to do three things. 1. To explore the attitudes towards postmortem investigations 2. To build pathology capacity in two large infectious diseases hospitals 3. To evaluate the use of a novel way of doing autopsies by only taking small samples using hollow needles from different sites of the human body. This is called minimally invasive autopsy (MIA).   Attitudes: A social scientist will explore the attitudes and perceptions towards postmortem investigations and sampling among a) the general public by inviting people to complete an online survey in a press release in national newspapers and b) healthcare professionals, religious leaders and patients relatives during focus group discussions. We will discuss postmortem investigations and sampling in general, and full autopsy and MIA in particular. We will show a video of both full and minimally invasive autopsies and ask participants to comment, to discuss their perceptions and beliefs regarding both procedures on a professional and personal level. Capacity: Simultaneously, we will build capacity for pathology in the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases and Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi. This will include purchase of necessary equipment and consumables for taking and analysing biopsy and MIA samples, training of Vietnamese clinical and laboratory staff by UK based pathologists and enabling implementation of pathology in routine clinical diagnostics, e.g. liver biopsy in infectious diseases of the liver Evaluation: Evaluate the contribution of MIA to establish the cause of death in patients who have died from one of three infectious clinical syndromes: infection of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), of the lungs (pneumonia) and of the bloodstream (sepsis/septic shock). After obtaining permission from relatives, we will use the validated MIA protocols - adapted to be acceptable locally using information from the Attitude phase - to take samples from the deceased patient and we will use general and pathogen specific pathologic examination and highly sensitive molecular techniques that detect genetic information of almost all known infectious agents (next generation sequencing) to establish cause of death. We will do this on a total of 100 patients.   All OUCRU's work is made available in open-access publications, and will be presented at (inter)national conferences and at policy groups. Public Engagement (PE) activities will be designed and coordinated by the very active OUCRU PE team, working with project researchers and health workers in each site to implement and communicate these activities.",

      "Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a bacteria that causes tuberculosis, an infectious disease that kills nearly 2 million people each year worldwide. Despite the availability of effective drug treatment for more than 50 years, and coordinated global efforts to control the disease, tuberculosis kills more people than any other infectious disease. One of the major reasons for the world's failure to control tuberculosis, and why it poses such a threat for the future, is that the bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to the drug treatments. This problem is compounded by the difficulty in detecting drug resistant bacteria, which grow very slowly in the laboratory and require special facilities to handle and test safely. The current standard methods for detecting tuberculosis drug resistance take 8-12 weeks to give results and are only available in specialist laboratories. In Vietnam, for example, which has >100,000 people with tuberculosis each year, there are only two laboratories in the country that can perform full tuberculosis resistance testing. The inadequacy and inaccessibility of currently available resistance detection methods means people with drug resistant tuberculosis are either diagnosed late, or not at all, which leads to more severe disease, on-going transmission of the infection to others, and more tuberculosis deaths. This problem is especially serious if a patient has so-called 'multi-drug resistant' (MDR) tuberculosis. MDR tuberculosis is defined by resistance to at least two of the most active 'first line' anti-tuberculosis drugs. It is much harder to treat, requiring four or five 'second line' drugs that are less effective than the 'first line' treatments and must be given for 12 months or more. Ideally, resistance testing would help doctors select the best drugs to treat people with MDR tuberculosis quickly and easily and thereby ensure the patient gets better faster. However, the current resistance detection methods are too slow (and are often unavailable) to help doctors and their patients. Our proposal will investigate a new solution to the problem of tuberculosis drug resistance testing. The team from the University of Oxford in the UK have been at the forefront of using the bacteria's genetic code (or DNA) to detect resistance against all anti-tuberculosis drugs. They have developed relatively simple methods that are able to look at the whole genetic code of a bacteria (or 'whole genome sequence') and rapidly predict whether or the not the bacteria are resistant to any or all of the anti-tuberculosis drugs by detecting the genetic mutations associated with resistance. These methods take a couple of days, not the 8-12 weeks of the current standard methods, and are so accurate that Public Health England now uses them in their routine service. Other developed countries are set to follow suit, but these genetic methods have yet to be tested in less well-resourced countries like Vietnam.  Our research team will develop 'whole genome sequencing' tuberculosis resistance testing in Vietnam's national tuberculosis reference laboratory in Hanoi. We will investigate whether the method can rapidly and accurately predict susceptibility or resistance to all anti-tuberculosis drugs from a culture of the bacteria, or directly from patients spit. We will do so in patients who are strongly suspected to have MDR tuberculosis. We will also investigate whether the method can be used to predict new drug resistance in patients who are failing treatment for suspected drug susceptible tuberculosis. In all these cases, we aim to provide proof-of-principle that the new method will give rapid and accurate results that will ultimately improve the way patients are treated. We will also assess the economic benefits of the new approach.  We hope that the information provided by the project will help support the future adoption of genetic resistance detection into Vietnam's tuberculosis treatment and control programme.",

Most of systematic genetic studies of HCM and DCM have focused on North American or Western European patient populations. This planned work will extend initial findings that some predominant mutations reported in Caucasians are absent in the Malaysian population and provide a comprehensive analysis of the genetic profiles of Malaysian cardiomyopathy patients. We hope the study will identify significant variants in the Malaysian population and provide valuable information to improve the clinical aspects of cardiomyopathy, including early diagnosis, prognosis and genetic counselling for affected families, in Malaysia. Overall, it will lead to improvement of the welfare of the population of Malaysia by improving the diagnosis and clinical management of cardiomyopathy in Malaysia with lasting benefits for patients and their families.",

      "The project aims to inform public policies concerning diabetes in Malaysia by producing evidence of its impact on people living with diabetes, on the health care system and society in general. Living with diabetes is a challenge and we will analyse how it affects people's health, for example by damaging the heart, eyes, feet and kidneys. We will also investigate the pressure that diabetes puts on Malaysia as a country, in terms of both human suffering and money. With the cost pressure set to grow, there are several opportunities to improve care for people with diabetes. We will analyse how the type of patient and access to different types of care may affect the health of people with diabetes, with a special focus on the poorest groups of society. The most deprived homes are likely to experience more harmful consequences of diabetes than those least deprived and tailored care approaches should be designed to meet the diversity of needs within the diabetic population.   The project will use data from people with type 2 diabetes in Malaysia provided through several large health datasets including the Malaysian National Diabetes Register, several clinical trials and a cohort study. Researchers from Malaysia and the United Kingdom will collaborate closely to develop a type 2 diabetes simulation model suitable for the Malaysian diabetic population. We will use the model to predict both diabetes-related health consequences and costs over the lifetime of people with diabetes in Malaysia. This will help identify opportunities and strategies for improving care for people with diabetes. These strategies are likely to incorporate a variety of complementary actions, from increasing the support for lifestyle changing behaviour, to improving education about diabetes and introducing health-improving and cost-saving drugs. Using the simulation model, we will be able to measure the impact of the proposed care plans relative to current care and evaluate whether they could achieve improvements in the health of people with diabetes and represent good value for money in Malaysia. Furthermore, in addition to assessing the healthcare system expenditure due to diabetes, we will also compare the difference in private payments between people with and without diabetes. This is to learn whether people with diabetes are at increased risk of poverty, and to inform debates about what additional financial support they may need compared to people without diabetes.   The findings from the project will be used to support national health policy and planning in Malaysia and improve healthcare spending for the treatment and prevention of diabetes. We intend to work closely with policy-makers and aim to help them build their capacity to tackle the challenges presented by diabetes. For example, we will hold workshops in Malaysia that will focus on the use of simulation models to strengthen evidence-based policy.",

      "Jordanian prehistory begins with the traces left by human ancestors on a key route out of Africa into Europe and Asia. This earliest phase is mainly known from scatters of flint tools made, used, and abandoned. Around 20,000 years ago, archaeological preservation improves providing evidence for some of the most profound changes in human history. These include the development of food producing technologies, the domestication of plants and animals, and the social and ideological developments that enabled living together in increasingly large and sedentary communities: what have been identified as the earliest modern societies (e.g. Cauvin 2000). Similar developments took place independently in a number of regions across the globe (Barker 2006), but their earliest manifestation was in Southwest Asia. Until recently, Jordan was considered as marginal to this process, but archaeological evidence now suggests that Jordan was important region to this transformation. Sites such as Kharaneh IV in the Epipalaeolithic show developments in subsistence and social complexity from c 20,000 years ago, while recent excavations at Shubayqa now provide evidence of permanent architecture from the Natufian period c 14,000 years ago. The earliest Neolithic, the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (12,000-10,300 years ago), was barely known in Jordan even a decade ago, but is now known from multiple sites. The Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (10,300 - 8,700 years ago), previously thought to derive from developments elsewhere, is now seen to incorporate local innovations when the Jordanian plateau became one of the most densely populated parts of the world. Although field evidence remains scarce, the Late Neolithic (8,300-6,500 years ago) continues a local historical trajectory when the farming package consolidates. Jordan plays an important role in the development of nomadic pastoralism following the domestication of sheep and goats. With notable exceptions, such as Profs Zeidan Kafafi of Yarmouk University and Maysoon al-Nahar of the University of Jordan, early prehistoric archaeological research has been dominated by international researchers, and has been marginal to archaeology and cultural heritage presentation within Jordan. The narrative of early prehistory has been largely written by international scholars, whose focus has been to place Jordanian evidence into a wider regional and global context. With the exception of scholars working directly on Jordanian material, most Near Eastern Neolithic archaeologists continue to downplay the significance of Jordan, indeed, with rare exceptions (such as mention of the large Late Pre-Pottery Neolithic B sites), Jordan does not register in regional syntheses, and the crucial early developments evident in Jordan are often omitted. Prehistory does not figure in Jordanian school education, despite the many resonances with contemporary issues of settling down, the growth of sedentary communities, and the early development of an agricultural package that still lies at the core of Jordanian subsistence. This project aims to develop a new generation of Jordanian scholars and cultural resource managers working in early prehistoric research. We will focus on Jordanian engagement, helping develop Jordanian skills, policies and procedures to research and manage prehistory, and to foster a new research environment with Jordanian perspectives and agendas. The project will seek to engage the wider Jordanian public in prehistory, where a lack of local interest translates into a lack of protection for these sites. We will raise the profile of prehistory, show its relevance to modern life in the origins of herding, farming, and water management, all vital to modern Jordanian society. We want to show this is a human and local story, not just academic and global. We will develop the tourism potential of prehistory, locally and internationally, to provide direct economic benefits to rural communities and the Jordanian economy.",

      "JCMT is the largest existing single dish millimetre (mm) and sub-millimetre telescope in the world, originally built by UK, and stationed at the Mauna Kea peak of the Haiwai'i island. The telescope is currently owned and operated by the East Asia Observatory (EAO), in which NARIT is a member of the organisation. NARIT is also heavily involved in the EAO up-coming plan to upgrade the various receiver instruments hosted in JCMT, in particular the heterodyne array HARP-B, which is a 16-pixel superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) mixer receiver. The plan is to replace HARP-B with a cutting-edge compact high sensitivity instrument with even larger pixel count to expand the mapping area and increase the mapping speed by at least an order of magnitude. The new receiver needs to be housed within the existing restricted space in the receiver cabin of JCMT without the need for major re-engineering of the facility, and this could be done by employing the latest heterodyne receiver technologies.  The success of this upgrading programme relies on the combination of various state-of-the-art technologies and support from numerous resources, which inevitably comes with significant human capacity and skills development challenges. Currently, Thailand has few astronomers or engineers who can design, construct and operate the instrument. But the pool of talented candidates whom can be trained and performed the job is large, due to the country's strong educational programme that equips the students with the required fundamental skills to uptake the challenging tasks. On the other hand, the scientific community in UK, particular the group in the University of Oxford and the University of Manchester, have many years of experience in developing technologies in the mm-wave and building instruments for various astronomical applications. Therefore, through this proposal, we aim to address these challenges by tapping into the UK's long heritage and highly developed skills in mm-wave astronomy and instrumentation, to train and prepare the personnel in NARIT with the fundamental skill-sets and technical know-how to contribute to the long-term programme of constructing mm-wave instruments for JCMT, and many other instruments, in the near future.  The two main research topics proposed in this program that would allow us to use these as platform to provide training and knowledge transfers are 1) Constructing a prototype linear 1 x 4 SIS mixer array at 350 GHz that could be further extended and stacked to form a much larger array e.g., an 8 x 8, 64-pixel array, aiming to upgrade the existing HARP-B in JCMT; and 2) Development of Low Noise Amplifiers (LNAs) above 70 GHz and produce compact and highly integrated packaging scheme for Focal Plane Array (FPA) receivers. These LNAs would have applications on the new Thai National Radio Telescope (125 GHz receiver) and JCMT (200-350 GHz), both of which NARIT have access to. We will use these research targets as the vehicle for technology transfer via bilateral UK-Thailand collaboration. Both projects will also incorporate many key skills of value to a developing knowledge economy such as engineering, electronics, cryogenics and telecommunications technology etc. We will also partner with the Thai astronomical and technical community to further propagate the technical knowledge acquired from astronomy instrumentation to the wider audience, bolstering the Thai general population skill base e.g., via public talks and outreach programme. This programme will not only help to develop the skills that Thailand urgently needs at this stage, but will also have impact on the wider economy through the increased uptake of undergraduates and graduates in Science Technology Engineering and Medicine (STEM) area, and up-skilling of current graduates and postgraduates in various other advanced science and technological fields.",

      "In 2016, delegates at the New York Declaration on Refugees and Migrants called for renewed attention to the burdens faced by host countries and communities affected by the arrival of refugees. While Europe had been the focus of much media attention during the so-called \"refugee crisis\" in 2015, the vast majority of the world's refugees live in low- and middle-income countries of the Global South, where host communities often face economic hardships even before the arrival of displaced populations. The New York Declaration recognised that if this burden was not addressed, refugees would face increasing hostility in the countries where they seek asylum.\n\nOne response has been to include hosts in refugee programming, a strategy intended to foster social cohesion, contribute humanitarian resources to local development, and reduce xenophobia among displacement-affected communities. However, the evidence base supporting this approach is largely economic - focused on the burdens and benefits of hosting refugees - with few anthropological and sociological studies that address the more intimate social aspects of hosting that influence popular stereotypes and community relations. This is reflected in the lack of definition for policy objectives like 'social cohesion', which often refers vaguely to the sense of solidarity within or between communities. There has been little critical study of the premises upon which social cohesion programmes are devised, their effectiveness in achieving intended social outcomes, or the unintended structural and political consequences of extending the remit of humanitarian programmes to include hosts.\n\nThis project entails an in-depth ethnographic study of social cohesion programmes and the contexts in which they are implemented, bringing sociological, historical, and anthropological lenses to bear on the recent 'host inclusivity' turn in humanitarian responses to displacement. Comparative research will be undertaken in multiple sites across two countries hosting large refugee populations - Kenya and Lebanon - with a multi-disciplinary research team drawing on expertise in the areas of policy and planning studies, urban studies, and peace and security studies. Researchers will spend extended periods of participant observation among communities involved in social cohesion interventions, and community members will engage directly in the research through participatory working groups. Qualitative insights will be supplemented by a number of short quantitative impact assessments of the effectiveness of different interventions in achieving their intended social outcomes.\n\nIn addition to its academic contributions, this project would inform the strategies that humanitarian organisations adopt to reduce refugee-host tensions, improve the mutual benefits of programmes that engage both groups, and mitigate unintended outcomes. Impact will be amplified via our project partner the Jesuit Refugee Service, an international refugee protection NGO that has put 'social cohesion' at the centre of its 2018-2023 Strategic Framework.",

      "World food demand is predicted to double by 2050. Meeting this demand is a major global challenge, and requires increased crop yields at minimal environmental cost. Present-day high-yielding 'green revolution crop varieties' (GRVs) are inefficient in their use of nitrogen (N) fertiliser, an inefficiency that is costly to the farmer and damaging to the environment. The world needs new crops that are both higher yielding and have increased N use efficiency (NUE).   Our project fuses distinct UK/China expertise to improve rice NUE. It retains the outstanding features of current rice GRVs, and transforms them into Super-Rice varieties that are high yielding and have enhanced NUE. Using a pioneering approach combining the discovery of natural genetic variants with marker-assisted breeding and 'genome editing', we will create Super-Rice that will be high-yielding when grown with reduced N fertiliser inputs.  First, WPs1-3 exploit a variety of genetic, genomic and bioinformatics techniques to discover individual genetic variants that increase the NUE of rice GRVs. WP1 discovers the molecular identities of variant genes increasing NUE in the field. WP2 focusses on variants of the developmental regulatory genes that play overarching roles in controlling the growth and metabolism of plants. There is important precedent for exploiting such regulatory variation, because the initial GRVs themselves were created by use of such variants. WP3 focusses on the discovery of variants increasing the activity of the transporters that enable rice to extract N from the soil. However, the variants discovered in WPs1-3 may come from wild or other strains of rice that are not themselves GRVs. WPs1-3 therefore importantly use the new technique of genome-editing to specifically determine if these new variants increase NUE in GRV genetic backgrounds. Genome-editing enables precise alteration of genome sequence, thus enabling us to edit specific GRV gene sequences (change them into the newly discovered variant form). The yield of these genome-edited GRVs will then be measured in low-N soils, thus telling us if the newly discovered variant can indeed increase the NUE of the GRV.  Next, WP4 further exploits the ability of genome editing to simultaneously edit more than one genomic location. This enables the combined ('stacked') introduction of multiple variants into one GRV. It is possible that variant combinations will generate NUE increases that are at least additive (a simple sum of individual variant effects) and that may be synergistic (increases that are greater than the simple sum effects of individual variants). Thus, in WP4, we will combine ('stack') multiple selected variants into Super-Rice genotypes, and then determine the yields of these Super-Rice genotypes in low-N soils.  Our genome-edited Super-Rice will not contain any 'foreign' transgenes, and may therefore more readily receive regulatory approval for agricultural use than will transgenic 'GM' varieties. However, because full adoption of Super-Rice requires general public acceptance, we will also pioneer the use of genome-edited Super-Rice to enhance the efficiency, focus and speed of conventional marker-assisted breeding of Super-Rice. Genome-edited Super-Rice will guide plant breeders in the development of (non-genome-edited) Super-Rice that will be bred using natural rice variants and that will be publicly acceptable because it is neither GM nor genome-edited.  The promotion of bilateral UK-China rice research relationships is another major objective of our proposal. We build upon and sustain pre-existing partnerships (XF and NPH; XF and QQ), and derive added value from a new one (NPH and QQ). In summary, we propose a transnational UK-China partnership that will breed publicly acceptable enhanced-NUE Super-Rice that will enhance the sustainability of Chinese and world agriculture and help feed the world in the years leading up to 2050 and beyond.",

      "Nitrogen is an essential element of biological molecules and life on earth. Lack of usable nitrogen limits growth of microbes, plants, and animals. Lack of nitrogen in agricultural soils limits plant production of food, feed, fibre and fuel. Nature solved the nitrogen limitation problem via evolution of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in diazotrophic bacteria that reduce atmospheric N2 to NH3, which is readily assimilated into biological molecules. Biological nitrogen fixation is catalyzed by a complex metalloenzyme called nitrogenase whose oxygen-sensitivity may explain its restricted distribution amongst prokaryotes. Some plants, including most legumes and a few non-legumes form intimate, nitrogen-fixing symbioses with diazotrophs that provide the plants with ammonia. As a consequence, legumes have been an integral part of sustainable agricultural systems for thousands of years. However, in an effort to increase plant yields large-scale use of industrially-produced N-fertilizer has doubled the influx of N into the terrestrial biogeochemical N-cycle, with serious negative consequences for human health and the natural environment. Therefore, the long-term sustainability of massive N-fertilizer inputs in agriculture has come into question. A team of eight investigators in India and two in the UK have come together to enhance the use of legumes, increase their effectiveness at fixing nitrogen and develop endophytic diazotrophs for use on cereals such as rice. Our focus is on pigeon pea, which is the second most widely planted legume in India but suffers from poor rates of BNF and low yields. We will select elite lines of pigeon pea and competitive rhizobial inoculants to maximise yields while improving their robustness. In addition we will develop phosphate solubilising strains of rhizobia as the supply of phosphorous often limits the rates on BNF and plant yield. Desirable traits for BNF and phosphate solubilisation will then be stacked into rhizobial inocula. A final long-term aim is the transfer of BNF to cereals, particularly rice, by the use of endophytic diazoptophs that can be inoculated onto cereals. This will be done both by selection of new endophytic diazotrophs and by manipulation of the control of BNF and ammonia secretion in elite strains. To achieve these aims we bring together the national leaders in India and the UK with expertise in bacterial and plant genetics, genomics, biochemistry, molecular and cell biology, physiology, synthetic biology combined with a deep knowledge of BNF in Indian soils and different regions. Improving BNF in our target plants will increase croyields for resource-poor farmers while decreasing the use and environmental-impact of industrial N-fertilizers.",

      "Achieving energy access for all is a UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) in itself, and directly facilitates the SDGs of sustainable industrialisation, sustainable cities and communities, and reducing inequality. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the most energy-deprived region in the world, arguably constitutes the greatest obstacle for realising these goals. An estimated 700 million people in SSA - the majority of them in rural areas -lack electricity access, a number that is only expected to rise as the continent's rural population growth outpaces capacity growth. The three SDG dimensions of achieving energy access - affordability, reliability and sustainability - each stand in stark contrast to the status quo: while the cost of electricity in SSA can be orders of magnitude higher than in industrialised countries, blackouts are frequent, and less than a quarter of energy supply comes from renewable sources. Energy poverty has impaired SSA's economic development since its independence in the 1960s, indicating that new approaches are urgently required.   Given the extent of rural energy poverty, limited rural purchasing power and logistical difficulties, innovative, locally driven business models for the renewable energy sector are required to achieve comprehensive rural electrification in SSA. In particular, rapidly falling system costs have made renewable off-grid solutions the cheapest and cleanest option in many remote areas. However, three main issues have prevented sustainable electrification: difficulties in attracting international investment to small-scale renewables; inconsistent and often opaque regulatory and institutional frameworks; and a failure to include local communities, i.e. customers, in planning. Research to date is alarmingly scarce in all three of these areas in SSA.   This interdisciplinary research therefore aims to design integrated, actionable and transferable development strategies for the local renewable energy sector capable of delivering comprehensive, sustainable rural electrification in SSA. Echoing the GCRF call's sentiment, we believe that the way to unlock this potential is via scaling up small to medium-sized innovative business models, institutional reforms and social inclusion strategies. The research pursues three mutually reinforcing areas of inquiry: suitable business models for a competitive local renewable electrification industry; optimal institutional arrangements to facilitate the development of the industry; and enabling community involvement, especially in rural areas. We deploy a comparative country case study approach, focusing on the contrasting situations of Uganda and Zambia, in order to increase the generalizability of our findings for other countries in SSA.   The proposed project is deeply committed to deliver impact beyond academia. Identifying current barriers to scaling rural electrification and developing solutions to overcome them can only be successfully achieved through including local business, public sector and communal stakeholders. These stakeholder groups - including Uganda's and Zambia's regulatory and legislative bodies, local businesses, and civil society - will therefore be repeatedly engaged throughout and, where possible, beyond the project. We will use several channels to implement our results: practitioner reports targeted at African renewable energy SMEs and energy regulators; the development and implementation of innovative business models, including novel financing and revenue schemes developed with community input; a digital SME renewable energy network where different companies in SSA can directly engage with one another; workshops to convene all stakeholder groups; private one-to-one meetings with public sector representatives; and research seminars at local universities to train future decision-makers. Given our focus on a local, African-owned and -run industry, we also foresee further benefits for local employment and knowledge creation.",

      "This project develops a dynamic Mediation Model for Sustainable Infrastructure Development (MMSID) to promote inclusive economic development and social welfare in the context of Chinese mega infrastructure initiatives in Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. While large-scale infrastructure projects represent a key mechanism of economic growth and development, they also bring unintended and negative consequences to local populations and environments. These challenges can be compounded by specific regional contexts. This is the case in contemporary Asia where China's One Belt-One Road (OBOR), representing more than £1 trillion in investments, is set to transform societies, economies and landscapes through infrastructure megaprojects. Opaqueness in Chinese procurement rights points to the potential for resource contestation between current rural users and state-driven contracts. This contrasts with standards established by international funders such as IFC, World Bank, ADB and OECD. The speed and scale of OBOR investments present particular social and environmental challenges to China's neighbouring states of Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia and Tajikistan. This includes project siting, use of scarce resources such as water, and land degradation. In addition, these states have limited capacity of national government agencies, weak governance institutions, historically poor inclusion of local populations in development processes, fragile, dryland and mountain environments and the prevalence of Sinophobia. These challenges result in the need to foster trust, transparency and cooperation between stakeholders to maintain social cohesion and ensure inclusive economic development. The need to find a new path which combines economic growth and investment with social inclusion is pressing for political stability in the region.  In collaboration with our 2 international Co-Is based in Mongolia and Central Asia, our project addresses these needs by scaling up a pioneering dispute resolution model developed in Mongolia's mining sector. Based on this local participation and stakeholder engagement experience in Mongolia, the MMSID will be replicable, scalable and applicable to other contexts and countries anticipating large-scale investment in. Our MMSID builds upon research by the Co-I and PDRA in 2016-2017 on complaints mediated by the World Bank's Compliance Advisor Ombudsman in response to conflict over land and water appropriation and degradation at the $12 billion Oyu Tolgoi Mine. This process was led by a multi-stakeholder engagement initiative - Tri-Partite Committee (TPC) - which consisted of local pastoralists, local government and mine management. TPC's success shows great potential to scale up Mongolia's example into a replicable model in Central Asia, where there is a cultural and political affinity to Mongolia. The MMSID will be developed through a mixed-methods and participatory action approach. Appropriate methods, field sites and impact activities, have been chosen with research partners. Beneficiaries include: rural residents, local and national government, business stakeholders, international agencies, development practitioners, local and international academics. The project's 6 stages incorporate focused impact activities aimed to build long-term partnerships alongside capacity building and outputs. MMSID will be applied and disseminated through publications, knowledge exchanges, communication platforms, research uptake activities and extensive interactive trainings. The project advances understanding of infrastructure-induced transformations, encourages effective local business engagement and stresses capacity building for development of more inclusive and robust institutional, legal and regulatory frameworks. Our proposal benefits from ten months of scoping work in Central Asia which ensured research feasibility and co-design of research aims with in-country partners and will foster immediate, effective development of MMSID.",

      "Leave no one behind has been a key objective of the recently agreed UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  As the poor, in particular the youth and women, are often being marginalised and excluded from market participation due to unequal access to education, resources and information, empowering and including these segments into the main stream market and income creation activities turns out to be an important imperative to achieve SDGs and build an inclusive society. This is important as developing countries are witnessing an upsurge of young people in rather inadequate labour market. While emerging digital technologies can become both an equaliser and a disruptive factor in labour markets, they can empower both women and youth.  The decreasing cost of digital technology should thus foster and support new exchange mechanisms that will generate new models of value creation (Amit and Zott, 2012) and will lead business organisations towards network based systems (Dafe & Lewin, 1993; Dunbar & Starbuck, 2006). Many new digital technology-based business models have already been developed. These developments not only create new drivers for economic growth, but also lead to upgrading of capabilities of small business owners. Such increased capabilities will in turn enhance the welfare of the poor (Sen, 1999).  However, there are a number of gaps to fill in order for this potential to fully materialise. (1) Most of the research focuses on the evaluation of the impact of technology on development. Little is known about the business models that are needed to transform the benefits of technology into jobs, income and a driver for growth for the poor (Seelos & Mair, 2007). (2) The existing studies mostly focus on e-trading businesses that sell products or services online, and normally require considerable initial capital investment to start the business. What type of new business model can help the poor to benefit from digital technology?  This is an under-explored area for inclusive development. (3) Some research is available on how to use business models for digital innovations to support growth of new businesses and employment. How is it possible to design a business model to empower the poor who have no initial capital to benefit from technological progress is missing. What underlying institutional, regulatory and capability conditions are needed to ensure the success of such digital technology-based new business model? What role can the state and Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) play in this process? These questions will fill the significant gap and provide important policy and managerial implications. Drawing on inter-disciplinary research from technology, development studies and responsible business studies, this project aims to fill in the gap in the literature with an Inclusive Digital Model (IDMODEL) that will particularly include deprived youth and women. In particular, it will: 1) Develop, test and finalise a digital technology-based new business model which enables poor people to start a business based on their skills and experiences, while requiring minimum capital investment.  2) Evaluate the impact of this DT-based business model on jobs, income creation and capabilities building.  3) Analyse the underlying regulatory and capability conditions that are needed to ensure its success and scale up, and the possibility to replicate in other developing countries. 4) Examine how the state, MNEs and civil society can collaborate for inclusive development. The project will be supported by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers from the universities of Oxford and Birmingham, and collaborators in Bangladesh and China from both the private and public sectors.  It will contribute to the literature by filling current gaps on technology, business model and inclusive development and its impact as well as producing novel datasets and robust empirical evidence to elaborate relevant policies for development.",

      "Children with a small vocabulary are at a disadvantage for all aspects of learning. Unless there is targeted support, children who start slow will continue to fall behind their language-rich peers.  A powerful way to ensure all children are ready for learning, particularly in school, is to offer high quality oral language education early in a child's life.  The power of early language intervention is supported by a large body of evidence showing a combined foundation of strong spoken language and listening comprehension cascading to reading and writing skills.  However, little is known about the efficacy of oral language interventions in low- and middle-income countries where communities are often multilingual.  We aim to address this gap in the literature through a mixed-methods study with children ages of 3-to-6 living in India and the Philippines.  The study will examine oral language development under the particular complexities of multilingual urban poor settings.  Research in these settings is of importance as there is reason to believe resources that spontaneously support children's language development may be under strain for the urban poor (e.g. reduced social networks, a new school language), making them a particularly vulnerable group for school failure.  A co-developed project  The proposed project was co-developed by multiple agencies.  Government partners shared that a pressing systemic concern was the low literacy rates in primary schools.  Community partners stressed the need for evidence on quality programs that will work in local schools and university partners echoed the need for a comprehensive program of research.  We therefore propose to understand children's language development in-context and will test an intervention that could potentially better prepare children for primary school.  The research sites will be Udupi district in India and Quezon City in the Philippines.  Defining characteristics of these sites include the multiple languages around the child and a policy commitment to either mother-tongue or multilingual education.  Hence, these contexts offer an opportunity to research a topic that is understudied in not just DAC countries but also internationally: children's oral language development and oral language intervention in a multilingual setting.  Objectives and Outputs  The primary objective of this research is to provide descriptive and causal evidence on quality (in early childhood development and pre-primary education) and readiness (for primary education) through three studies that aim to a) map opportunities and barriers to oral language development, b) validate assessments to track children's developing oral language and c) examine a targeted intervention delivered by teachers one year before entry into primary school.  We will map opportunities and barriers by following thirty children over one day to record their language experiences, examining language knowledge of their conversation partners, and conducting an ethnographic inquiry of classes they attend.  We will finetune fifteen assessments by analyzing 3000 data points on each test and, in a study with 800 children, evaluate a language intervention designed with teachers that draws upon folk tales and local narratives.  This inter-disciplinary project will provide an approach to reach the Sustainable Development Goal of effective learning outcomes for all children by focusing on the language bedrock of early childhood learning.  Outputs include evidence briefs for policy makers and open access toolkits for educators. Multiple bodies of data for the research community will expand the evidence-base in these contexts.  These include a word bank, an archive of child language, a rich description of talk in the classroom, performance data and outcomes data.  Taken together, the proposed research could potentially act as a catalyst for informed early childhood education in India, the Philippines, and other DAC countries.",

      "Global under-5 deaths have halved in the last 20 years(1). However, reduction in the neonatal mortality rate has lagged greatly behind other advances, and now contributes over 40% of all child mortality in many countries (1). Yet, prior research in low and middle income countries (LMICs) suggests sick newborns often do not receive the interventions they need to ensure their disability free survival.  Infections are estimated to cause 40% of all neonatal deaths in LMICs (2), where the burden health care-associated infections (HCAIs) is also up to 20 times higher than in industrialised countries (3)  and where antibiotic resistant HCAIs are rapidly increasing (4) due to increases in antibiotic use, rising rates of hospitalisation, and high prevalence HCAIs (5) not matched with increases in hospital resources and measures to prevent these. Resistant infections often lead to longer hospitalizations (6), thus increasing opportunity for transmission to other inpatients in care, and subsequent transmission into the community following hospital discharge. The potential societal impact of bacterial antibiotic resistance (BAR) infections in sick newborns in LMICs, is reflected in the 58,000 deaths attributable to antibiotic resistant neonatal sepsis in India alone (5) compared to the 23,000 deaths each year across all population age groups in the United States (7).  The much-needed attention to improve newborn health, has triggered multiple stakeholders to propose the 'Every Newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths' (8), which seeks to improve the quality of care to ultimately end preventable newborn deaths. HCAIs, reflect breakdown in infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, which combined with injudicious use of antibiotics contribute to emergence of resistant HCAIs in neonatal units (9), and are the most frequent preventable adverse event in healthcare delivery worldwide (3). Intervention bundles comprising behavioural, environmental and antibiotic stewardship components (10), could prevent many HCAIs (11-13), and improved provision of high-quality, basic care in resource-limited hospitals could deliver up to a 71% reduction in neonatal mortality (14,15).  Initiatives to improve quality and safety in healthcare, however, too often result in limited changes for the better and are often hard to replicate in new contexts (16). In this pump-priming grant, we seek to address key formative stages of the MRC framework for complex interventions (17,18) by generating contextual knowledge of the health system traits and behaviours that need to be understood prior to formulation and implementation of behavioural/integrated interventions to attain best IPC and antibiotic stewardship (IPC-ABS) practice required to reduce HCAIs and BAR in resource-limited healthcare facilities delivering care to sick newborns. In our approach, we draw from elements of the theory of change (ToC) (19,20), by first identifying the desired long-term goals and then working back from these to identify all the conditions that must be in place for the goals to occur. This proposed pump-priming grant includes research that aims to: a. Facilitate the development of appropriate, evidence based interventions based on a critical analysis of the policy, organisational and practice environments and current management, team and individual behaviours relevant to IPC-ABS, aimed at limiting BAR in high-risk populations in Kenyan facilities; b. Help identify context-appropriate clinical and performance indicators for use in monitoring and evaluation of IPC-ABS interventions; c. Highlight challenges in the uptake of policy into effective IPC-ABS practice; d. Increase capability and motivation to limit BAR and improve safety in hospitals; e. Initiate a process of building research capacity around IPC-ABS in Kenya.  We expect proposed interventions to be generalizable to other inpatient settings in East African hospitals that share similar challenges.",

      "In the context of Myanmar's political opening since March 2011, Buddhist activism has made headlines over the past two years due to outbreaks of communal violence across the country marked by religious difference, that threaten to derail Myanmar's once-promising transition. Many see a connection between these violent episodes and the rise of new Buddhist networks and organizations, including the 969 and MaBaTha movements. However, aspects of the conflict connected to religious identity are poorly understood and research on this topic needs to carefully address the ways in which anti-Muslim actions are difficult to separate from pro-Buddhist impulses. Equally important is the intersection between religious identities and gender, as much of the nationalist discourse focuses on the protection of women as a way of protecting both Buddhism and the nation. A critical aspect of this approach is to take seriously the fears and perceptions of different groups to understand how they shape attitudes towards others and towards religious and national identity.  This 2.5 year research project seeks to critically assess and disaggregate the category of \"Buddhist nationalism\" in Myanmar by focusing on two complementary aspects of the phenomenon: the production, dissemination, and resonance of narratives that potentially justify violence by positing a Muslim threat to Buddhism and the Burmese nation; and the gendered discourse of nationalism, produced through nationalist rhetoric and both reinforced and contested via the perspectives of women who, respectively, support and oppose it. First, what is the rhetorical and ideational content of this discourse of Muslim threat, driven especially by monks? Which political, religious, and cultural narratives (at local, regional, and global levels) do they employ and how do these resonate with Buddhists in Myanmar? How do these discussions reconfigure categories such as \"Buddhist\" or \"patriot\"? What are the potential counter-narratives that monastic and civil society actors are and should be putting forward in response?  The second component of the project considers the complex gendered elements of this discourse. Buddhist nationalist agitation in Myanmar has often focused on the protection of women and concerns regarding women's role as re-producers of the nation have motivated laws to protect them from the presumably predatory actions of non-Buddhist men. However, the narratives from women themselves present a more nuanced picture of their threat perceptions and how they see their role(s) vis-à-vis the religion, the nation and nationalist groups. In drawing on women's narratives, the project will also identify alternative articulations of religious, ethnic, or national identity that might challenge or complicate the current dominant anti-Muslim sentiment.  These research questions will be explored through assembling a database of sermons, speeches, and written materials from Buddhist and nationalist groups; monitoring media reporting on religious conflict; interviews with key actors in the Myanmar government, religious hierarchy, and civil society; and more detailed ethnographic study in particular places to better understand the production, resonance, and evaluation of nationalist narratives.  In the rapidly-changing political environment of Myanmar, the project will make immediate and regular contributions in the form of bi-annual policy briefs distributed to and discussed with religious and civil society actors, governments, foundations, and other international actors supporting these groups. By also analyzing the rhetoric and methods of those working to reduce religious violence, this study can gauge the effectiveness of their work and assist them in crafting campaigns that respond directly to the logic employed by those who are spreading inter-religious strife.",

The aim is to strengthen capacity and effectiveness in the conduct of such research among GCRF delivery partners, and other researchers running large-scale international development studies in LMICs through an innovative programme of methodological and operational reflection and learning amplified through an integrated communications strategy. The programme will draw primarily on the experience and expertise of staff and former staff of the Young Lives study but will also benefit from the knowledge of Young Lives collaborators, advisory committee members and other researchers and research managers.  The work will focus on two critical areas: research design and research governance and impact. Two further themes are proposed for a second year: data management and ethics. It will explore the opportunities, challenges and lessons learned from Young Lives research over more than 15 years, highlighting the justification for key decisions, as well as the mistakes made and solutions devised along the way. It will complement existing Young Lives methodological outputs and be driven by questions, themes and topics that are critical for effective delivery of international development research in LMICs.

      "There are millions of platform workers who live all over the world, doing work that is outsourced or organised via digital platforms or apps in the gig economy. This work can include jobs as varied as taxi driving using Uber, translation on Upwork, or the training of machine learning algorithms through Amazon's Mechanical Turk.   Despite the potential of such work to give jobs to those who need them, platform workers have little ability to negotiate wages and working conditions with their employers, who are often on the other side of the world. Our previous research has shown that platforms often operate in relatively unregulated ways, and can encourage a race to the bottom in terms of workers' ability to defend existing jobs, liveable wages, and dignified working conditions.   The potentials and risks of platform work touch down starkly in South Africa. A country that, by some measures, has the world's highest income inequality, and 28% unemployment rates. At the same time, the country has relatively well-developed internet infrastructure, and a relatively stable political climate and state/legal institutions. These factors make the country a site in which the platform economy is nascent enough to allow us to co-develop solutions with a multi-disciplinary team from Law and the Social Sciences that will offer tangible opportunities to influence policy and practice surrounding digital work. As other middle- and low-income countries quickly develop their internet infrastructures and millions of more potential digital workers rush online in search of opportunities, the interventions that this project proposes will be of crucial need if we are to avoid some of the 'race to the bottom' that the current world of digital work is bringing into being.   Our project will culminate in two key initiatives. First, building on a work package of legal research, a Code of Practice will be developed to  serve as an interpretive tool to outline the ways that existing regulations can be made applicable to platform workers. Second, we will develop a 'Fairwork Foundation.' Much like the Fairtrade Foundation has been able to certify the production chains of commodities like coffee or chocolate, the Fairwork Foundation will certify the production networks of the platform economy, and therefore harness consumer power to significantly contribute to the welfare and job quality of digital workers. This programme of work aims to not just uncover where fair and unfair work takes place, but also seeks to codify that knowledge into both a 'Fairwork certification scheme' and an annual ranking of platforms. These two initiatives will ultimately allow for the development of an international standard for good-quality digital working conditions.  These objectives will be achieved with 5 project stages. First, the Law team will analyse S. African labour laws, social security laws, and other legal and policy regulations relating to the platform economy, and ask how those laws might be adapted to provide decent work standards for digital platform workers. At the same time, the Social Science team will use a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to map the key issues faced by S. African platform workers: developing a rich understanding of how platform work may be failing to live up to decent work standards. Third, we develop meaningful decent work standards for platform work that happens outside of the Global North. Fourth, we take those standards and use them in a process of action research in which we seek to certify the digital work platforms: assigning them a Fairwork certification if they pass. Finally, through an extended process of stakeholder engagement and outreach with workers, platforms, and policy makers, we plan a short-term strategy of pressuring platforms to change their policies to improve working conditions and a longer-term strategy of influencing the direction that regulation takes in a currently highly unregulated sector.",

      "A UK and low-and-middle-income-country (LMIC) partnership that aims to improve quality-of-life for hip fracture patients and to reduce healthcare costs in India, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. \nOlder patients are particularly likely to break a bone (fracture) because of a fall from a standing height, as their bones are weakened by osteoporosis. These ‘fragility’ fractures have serious consequences; in the UK 25% of hip fracture patients die within a year and survivors have a reduction in their quality-of-life similar to having a stroke. Outcomes may be even worse in LMIC without the same level of healthcare resource. Asia is particularly affected by rapidly ageing populations. The number of hip fractures is expected to increase from 1,124,060 now to 2,563,488 in 2050. Associated healthcare cost may rise to US$15 billion. Improving care for patients with hip fracture is therefore a priority in this region. \nLooking after patients following a hip fracture requires healthcare workers from many different backgrounds to work together. These include surgeons, doctors specialising in looking after older patients, nurses and therapists, each with defined roles and responsibilities. In the UK, this team approach has reduced the number of patients dying and improved quality-of-life after hip fracture. It also reduced time spent in hospital and associated healthcare costs. \nThis study is about testing the benefits of such ‘multidisciplinary’ care in 5 LMIC in South Asia. To optimise the care, hospitals will receive a training package called HIPCARE. After refining the training materials to make HIPCARE specific to each country, we will do a large study to compare HIPCARE with usual care in 40 hospitals in LMIC in South Asia.",
      "The main aim is to improve the quality of life of patients after they have broken their hip and to reduce healthcare costs in low-and-middle-income-countries (LMIC). The project will have two principal objectives: \n1. To prepare the HIPCARE training package for each different country taking into account their specific healthcare system. \n2. To run a study to compare the quality of life of hip fracture patients who have been treated in a hospital where the HIPCARE training package has been introduced with patients who have been treated in a hospital that follows its standard care. \nWithin the study, the following seven outcomes will be compared between patients treated in HIPCARE hospitals and patients treated in Standard Care hospitals. The outcomes will be measured up to 4 months after hip fracture surgery: \n1) Quality of Life \n2) Mortality rate \n3) Mobility Status \n4) The need of residential care \n5) Complication rate \n6) Healthcare and resource needs \n7) Cost effectiveness of the trial treatments \nThese comparisons will be made for each country individually as well as for all countries together. In addition, this study will create a long-lasting research collaboration and sustainable infrastructure that can be used to facilitate future service improvements in each LMIC."

It is also essential that we live well. Disorders of the mind and brain become much more common as we get older. Increased rates of memory difficulties, strokes and seizures are all seen after the age of 50 years. We know that stroke is the most common cause for seizures in older people and that people who are initially from Africa have a higher risk of stroke. But this information is from studies done in America or Europe, and therefore we must study mindbrain health within Africa itself. \n\nIn this project, I will investigate how memory problems, stroke and seizures may be connected in African populations. I will base my work in Zimbabwe, where there has been a sharp rise in the number of older people. In Zimbabwe, the rates of HIV have been very high and HIV-associated complications are now being seen in later life. The infrastructure to cope with this immense need in older people is, however, extremely limited. \n\nI will work closely with my colleagues in Zimbabwe, whom I have known for over seven years. Together, we have delivered a lot of research into epilepsy. In this project, I will take advantage of seizures being a gateway into many neurological disorders to improve our broader understanding of mind-brain health. In Africa, seizures and epilepsy (which is when seizures can happen more than once) are deeply stigmatised, especially among older people. This research will work to understand why.",
      "This project has 6 key objectives: \n\n1.\tAccelerate knowledge about brain disorders at all levels, from community through to Ministers of Health. We will start by holding community-led workshops and focus groups. We will take oral histories from a large number of older people with lived experience of epilepsy, stroke and dementia. These three conditions inter-connect very closely together, especially in older populations. We will speak with affected individuals, their principal carers and family members.\n\n2.\tDestigmatise brain health disorders: we will explore the stigma that can surround brain disorders, including impacts on relationships, employment, personal well-being and mental health.\n\n3.\tBetter diagnose brain health disorders: we will work with older Zimbabweans to create solutions to these difficulties and engage interested individuals to shape the rest of the project.\n\n4.\tRefine technologies to enable longitudinal deep phenotyping of people with later onset epilepsy and stroke. We will recruit and monitor a large group of Zimbabweans who have had a stroke to work out what makes a seizure more likely in this population. We will track people with epilepsy that starts after the age of 50 years to identify what happens to their memory and find out if they may be at increased risk of stroke.  We will improve the technologies that we have developed to help people with epilepsy in Africa. We will test markers that may stratify people according to their risk of brain health difficulties.\n\n5.\tDevelop tailored guidelines around scalable interventions that align with the World Health Organisation Intersectoral Global Action Plan (WHO IGAP). Once we have better understood the risk factors contributing to brain disorders in older Zimbabweans, we will test whether specific treatments can reduce these risks and improve health outcomes. We will work with the WHO and local Ministers of Health to improve healthcare systems.\n\n6.\tCreate a Zimbabwean Centre of brain health."

      "Injuries are the leading cause of death in people aged between 10-49 years. More people die from injuries than from HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis combined. For every person who dies, up to 50 people survive but become disabled. Broken bones account for most of these injuries, and disproportionately affect people living in poorer regions, such as countries in Africa. Little is known about how many individuals in Africa sustain a broken bone, what healthcare services are available to treat them, how the injury affects individuals and their families, or ways to improve their recovery.\n\nAcross three African countries (Malawi, Tanzania, and South Africa) we aim to:\n1. Develop the ability to undertake research into the care of broken bones. \n2. Determine the number of people affected by a broken bone. \n3. Describe the healthcare resources available for the treatment of broken bones and identify factors that help or hinder the delivery of services. \n4. Assess the impact of a broken bone on the life and livelihoods of those affected. \n5. Improve the recovery of patients who have experienced a broken bone. \n\nMethods: \nOur project has four themes:\n\n1. Capacity: Doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers involved in the care of patients with broken bones have limited training in how to conduct research and poor access to the basic resources to do research, making it difficult to improve the care for their patients. We will assess current levels of research training and organisation, designing educational resources to fill gaps in the current understanding and ability to undertake research.\n\n2. Mapping: We will create a network of collaborating hospitals, in our partner countries, to perform a study to determine how often different types of broken bones occur. We will look at five broken bones that the World Health Organisation (WHO) have identified to cause the most disability and describe the resources (people and equipment) available to treat these injuries and find out how patients make use of these services.\n\n3. Outcome: We will examine how patients recover from their injury and the impact on their lives and livelihoods for each of the five types of broken bones.\n\n4. Change: Through our network of collaborating hospitals, we will undertake a multi-centre study to ‘test’ if it is possible to do large-scale research studies. Our goal is to run similar studies throughout Africa to assess new treatments for patients with broken bones.\n\nThis project will help us understand the number of broken bones that occur in Africa, what treatments are available and how these injuries affect patients. It will develop research capacity and lay the foundations to attract future research funding, enabling us to work towards our vision that the care for broken bones in poor countries can be safe, accessible, and appropriate to the resources of local health systems. This project will run from September 2024 to August 2028. \n\nCommunity engagement and involvement: We have engaged with local patients and healthcare workers, whose opinions have informed our work so far. We will continue to integrate patients and community leaders to co-produce our research.\n\nDissemination: Patients, clinicians and methodologists will co-develop publications, social media, and events. We will work alongside policy makers in national government ministries and strengthen our relationship with leaders within the WHO to ensure that we disseminate our findings effectively and influence policy to drive improved patient care.",
      "This project has 4 objectives:\n\n1. Evaluate the available resources for conducting clinical research & develop research capacity and leadership.\n2. Quantify the incidence of musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries & define the healthcare resources currently available for MSK injury care.\n3. Assess MSK injury treatment pathways, clinical & quality of life outcomes, and economic impact.\n4. Implement a multi-centre feasibility study to inform a randomised control trial."

      "Childhood injuries are a leading cause of death and disability, with 90% of injury burden reported in low- and middle-income countries. Being the leading cause of death for children aged 5 and above, injuries kill more than half a million children every year. Children with non-fatal injuries are frequently left with disabilities adversely impacting their development and quality of life. Childhood injuries contribute to a loss of economic productivity at individual, family, societal and national levels; they lead to catastrophic health expenditures, time off school and work, and impose a significant burden on healthcare systems. Sub-Saharan Africa has a high burden of childhood injury, which may be preventable through simple, cost-effective interventions instituted at family and community levels.\n\nThis proposal, co-led by the University of Oxford and University of Zimbabwe, aims to reduce the burden of disease from injuries among children aged 6 to 12 years in Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Addressing childhood injuries within community settings has been identified as a national priority by decision-makers in both countries, but policymakers in the two countries lack the necessary information for evidence-based resource allocations. The lack of published childhood injury data in the region prevents a comprehensive understanding of factors associated with childhood injuries, care processes, and outcomes; all of which would support the development of interventions to prevent injury occurrence, and improve post-injury care and long-term rehabilitation. This study, funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research, seeks to fill this knowledge gap over four years, between 2024 and 2028. \n\nOur research programme will address the World Health Organization’s World Report on Child Injury Prevention recommendations:\n\n1) enhance the quality and quantity of data for child injury prevention.\n2) research on the causes, consequences, costs, and prevention of child injuries.\n3) implement specific actions to prevent and control child injuries.\n4) strengthen health systems to address child injuries.",
      "The project has 4 objectives:\n\n1.1. Undertake a meso-level study of select locations within both nations to assess the trauma burden in children, including its drivers, care pathways, outcomes, and economic implications in Tanzania and Zimbabwe. \n1.2. Assess access to health services for injured children in Tanzania and Zimbabwe. \n1.3. Understand specific child road safety risks in Tanzania and Zimbabwe. \n\n2.1. Develop cost-effective strategies to reduce the burden of trauma experienced by children across Tanzania and Zimbabwe.\n2.2. Test the feasibility and acceptability of strategies developed to reduce the burden of childhood injuries.  \n2.3. Inform policymaking regarding child injury prevention. \n\n3.1. Assess resource use, costs, and hospital-system efficiencies in the delivery of paediatric trauma care across networks of referral and district hospitals.\n3.2. Support value-based resource allocation for optimised delivery of paediatric trauma care in Tanzania and Zimbabwe. \n\n4.1. Develop a sustainable, community-led quality improvement initiative that introduces baseline standards for access and outcomes of paediatric trauma care (The Paediatric Trauma - Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes: PT-ECHO) in Tanzania and Zimbabwe. \n4.2. Implement and evaluate the impact of the PT-ECHO initiative on improving access, quality, and outcomes of paediatric trauma care within the targeted communities."

      "Antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacterial infections are a rising global cause for concern. AMR is increasingly being predicted to significantly affect health and wellbeing on an international scale, and new technologies and greater understanding are required to reduce resistance to effective treatments. Monitoring how AMR progresses and increasing our understanding into how, when and where AMR emerges are essential to respond to the growing crisis and assess how effective local, national and international interventions are.  Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) is a technology becoming more frequently used in public health communities and offers the ability to provide information at an individual level, as well as at a regional, national and international scale due to its digital nature. Using this surveillance combined with rapid data reporting, will strengthen the evidence base of research, which is crucial for public health decision makers and their capacity to respond. Progress is being made in technical support for practical uses. However, the remaining major problem is how to rapidly and routinely link data and its interpretation to provide the greatest value at all levels.\n\nOur global multi-institutional partnership unit brings together established collaborations between the UK (Centre of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance -CGPS, Oxford University), Philippines (Research Institute for Tropical Medicine - RITM), Ibadan (University of Ibadan), India (KIMS Hospital and Research Centre) and Colombia (Colombian Agriculture Research Corporation AGROSAVIA) to continue to combat this growing problem. Capacity for WGS of AMR at each key site has been established or embedded into developing and existing national surveillance initiatives and has already helped outbreak detection and tracking of AMR populations. Building upon this foundation, the data landscape now needs to be put into use to guide public health policies and practices.\n\nThrough our partnerships we aim to reduce AMR bacterial infections through bettering WGS and surveillance across each site. Our main goals and objectives are detailed below.\n\nThe project will leave a legacy of engineering, data science and data driven surveillance by using WGS and achieving the highest value of the data on policy.

      "Essential technologies could improve quality and outcomes of care if they are successfully adopted but benefits in poorer countries are threatened by workforce shortages and a failure to consider all the obstacles to their use up and down the system. Thus, many technologies fail, for example it is reported there are over 200,000 failed mHealth apps. This wastes valuable resources, or can even worsen care quality. Our proposal addresses this key emerging issue in Kenya. In doing this we address the priority areas of Quality of Care, including families’ experiences of care; Health Workforce Management and Planning, as we explore how technologies can support or undermine routine work in settings with few staff; and Integrating Health Services & Improved Data Quality and Use, by exploring how information technologies might best support post-discharge care for sick babies.This research has the direct and primary aim of improving the health, wellbeing and economic development of people in low and middle income countries.",
      "We have two broad objectives: \n1. To learn how technologies can be better designed and introduced in weak health systems to yield benefits and reduce harms and waste.\n2. To build capacity of government and researchers for these difficult but important evaluations so they help poorer countries strengthen their health systems.\nTo achieve these in Work-package 1 we will design and conduct an evaluation using multiple approaches of a large existing hospital technology intervention programme. We will deliberately change staff numbers to explore how this affects quality and technology adoption. In Work-package 2, we focus on using methods that involve staff and families to co-design an approach that helps schedule the care sick babies need after hospital discharge and ensures all health staff and families have access to key information needed for follow up care. This work will produce an outline technology for testing with new funding. In Work-package 3 we tackle cross-cutting issues including how technologies are changing the jobs people do and the skills they need individually and as teams to give quality care and explore what oversight mechanisms are needed to gain good evidence on the effects of introducing technologies in health."

      "Our research stems directly from knowledge gaps articulated by our partners in Nepal, including residents, local and central government, the UN, and humanitarian and development practitioners. The research is intended to benefit five specific groups:\n\n1) Our primary goal is to positively impact residents living with systemic risk. We seek to better understand the socio-political and economic processes that affect everyday lives and through which systemic risk is produced and in which multi-hazards are experienced, using a co-produced and interdisciplinary approach. Our work will impact those tasked with managing risk to focus on the everyday needs of residents and ensure that efforts to reduce risk are placed within the appropriate physical and socio-political contexts. Where resources or capacity are lacking, we will work to enable local government to support residents to collectively manage their own risk by building on their own knowledge and providing new knowledge to support planning, forecasting, and messaging. We will also provide innovative means of messaging, using locally produced radio dramatisations, to exploit our new interdisciplinary science to improve decision-making, working with local people and local government to make this as effective as possible.\n\n2) The UN Resident Coordinator's Office (RCO) and Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) are tasked with planning preparedness and response to major disasters, but this planning has had a limited scientific basis and concentrates on narrowly-defined impacts of earthquakes and flooding. There remains no consideration of dynamic multi-hazard scenarios and the risks they generate. Our project will benefit the RCO and HCT by grounding their plans in interdisciplinary science and by building greater awareness of the socio-political and physical context in which their planning sits, allowing cross-sectoral decisions that consider the impacts associated with multi-hazard events and evaluate the multi-temporal variation in risk caused by changing population exposure and vulnerability. The development of novel protocols to prepare for and respond to multi-hazard disasters will enable the RCO and HCT to make better, more effective use of local knowledge and interdisciplinary science.\n\n3) Our previous work in Nepal has identified capacity gaps in government agencies at national, provincial and, most importantly, municipal levels. These gaps reflect a lack of understanding of the dynamic nature of the hazard chain and a lack of viable options for managing the consequent risk. Our project will benefit government risk management by significantly increasing capacity through developing and embedding a system for monitoring multi-hazard risk, and by situating this understanding within a broader socio-political context. We will engage with municipal government through existing networks and capacity-building programmes. This proposal is highly timely, coinciding with Nepal's transition to a new federal structure, allowing the research team to feed directly into new governance structures as they form.\n\n4) Through the Community-Based Disaster Risk Management Platform, our work will have direct impact on the NGOs that implement disaster risk reduction projects. We will co-produce guidance on the use of local and scientific knowledge for reducing risk from the mountain hazard chain, as well as ethical and practical guidance for researchers on working with practitioners in Nepal.\n\n5) The ethos of our project is based around developing the next generation of hazard and risk specialists in Nepal. We will support 15 early-career researchers, with 9 employed in Nepal. We will convene workshops specifically around skills and professional development for these researchers, and will also invite early-career professionals from our government, NGO, and UN project partners to provide the foundations for the future leaders of this sphere of work in Nepal.",

      "Malaria remains one of the greatest threats to global public health, with 207 million cases of falciparum malaria and 627,000 deaths occurring in 2012, with over 80% of deaths occurring in Africa. More than 80% of malaria is transmitted indoors at night, so the number of malaria mosquitoes which enter a house is critical for getting the disease - with people living in 'leaky' houses being at most risk. We have shown that closing the eaves (the gap between the top of the wall and the roof) and screening a house can reduce dramatically the number of malaria vectors entering a house. Here we propose to find out whether we can protect children against malaria by modifying half the study houses so that they (1) have a metal roof, (2) closed eaves, (3) screened doors and windows and (4) screened-air bricks which allow the warm air to rise out of the house, but not let any mosquitoes indoors. The other study houses will be left with thatched roofs and open eaves and the children in these houses will serve as a comparison group.  Over the past thirty years a silent revolution in house design has been happening across Africa. The traditional thatched-roofed houses are being replaced steadily by metal-roofed houses as the continent develops. We hope to ride this wave of cultural change and further improve the design of houses to make them healthier to live in. Improved housing has the potential to improve the lives of millions of people across sub-Saharan Africa including Gambia (The).",

      "In 2009, there were 42,000 newborn deaths and they accounted for 40% of all deaths among children under 5 Kenya. This high neonatal mortality is a major reason why Kenya is not succeeding in its battle to reduce child deaths in line with stated targets. Recognising this, the Ministry of Health has started to focus on improving newborn (and maternal) health with strategies aimed at communities and small clinics. However, sick or vulnerable newborns will often require inpatient care in referral facilities from skilled workers with access to basic technologies. Interventions typically delivered at this level include, for example, fluids or feeds for those unable to suck or oxygen for respiratory support. Such interventions require carers to perform the same, time-consuming tasks multiple times per day for many days. Shortage of skilled health workers often means these services are inadequately delivered, potentially delaying or preventing recovery. We are planning research that will establish: the potential burden of severe neonatal illness; what existing infrastructure and human resource capacity is available supporting access for this population; utilisation of these services; and the quality of existing nursing care services. We will do this focusing on Nairobi's population of 5 million, many of whom are very poor. With a focus on universal coverage and neonatal care meeting agreed standards, this work will provide the basis for estimating the gap between available and needed services (Gap 1) and the quality gap between existing and desired services (Gap 2). In partnership with important stakeholders, we will explore how a low-income country might best tackle health workforce challenges to close these gaps and improve provision of essential nursing care to all sick newborn babies in an affordable and efficient way. This ultimate aim of research is driven by the fact that salary costs are a major proportion of total health care costs. One option will therefore be to explore alternatives to employing professional nurses if necessary interventions can be effectively provided by other groups under the supervision of professionals - an approach known as task-shifting. Although task-shifting sounds a simple solution, it may not always be. Failure to consider national regulations, the opinions of important professionals, managers or parents may lead to the approach being rejected or failing. Taking account of the local situation may be particularly important when those being cared for are sick, newborn babies and when day to day care has traditionally been given by professional, even specialist nurses.  First, therefore, we will define with the major groups what forms of care should be available to all, learn what regulations exist on providing care, and consider the concerns of major groups with respect to task-shifting. We will examine carefully all the things that nurses have to do in a range of different facilities, explore with experts which tasks may be simple enough for others to do, and examine whether there is time to do all the essential care tasks. We will estimate how much need there is for neonatal nursing care in Nairobi and the gap between what is available and what is needed. Using all these data we will explore how many new staff might be needed to improve the delivery of essential care for all newborns in need. We will also undertake preliminary work to explore the costs of meeting this need using extra professional nurses or if tasks were shifted to other, lower cost staff. Possible roles for lower cost staff will be informed by work examining what tasks to shift and how they might fit within existing patterns of providing care.  All this work will be conducted with the major decision makers in health, health professionals and parents to develop options sensitive to local conditions. Based on this body of work we aim to develop a task-shifting approach that can be tested in Kenya in the future.",

      "There are few services to support children with neurological disabilities and their families in resource poor settings, such as those found in sub-Saharan Africa. The parents and carers report that the two main features that impair their child's and family's quality of life are difficulties with their child's behaviour and communicating with the child. Recent reviews of the literature have supported that parent interventions may be the most acceptable and feasible way to improve communication and behaviour. In particular, the Stepping Stones parenting programme, which has been developed for parents of children with disabilities was suggested as an appropriate intervention, since it does not require specialised therapists, does not involve hours of therapy and empowers the parents and carers. This programme has been used in over 23 countries, shown to be effective in improving behaviour and communication in children with disabilities; but has not been tested in low-resource settings.  The World Health Organization has also recognised these interventions, and promotes them through the mental health treatment gap interventions for children with developmental disorders. In addition the WHO has developed a a parent based intervention i.e. Parent Skills Training to improve communication and behaviour, but this intervention has not been tested in the field.   The objectives of this grant are to examine the cultural acceptability and feasibility of administering two interventions i.e. Stepping Stones Programme and Patent Skills Training delivered through parents or carers to improve the communication, behaviour and quality of life of children with neurological disabilities. In particular we will identify the barriers to the administration of a parent intervention. In addition we will examine the reliability, validity and responsiveness of tools to measure behaviour, communication, parenting, stress and quality of life in these settings.   This data of this project will be used to develop an intervention to be tested in a randomised control trial. Testing the interventions are likely to provide some support to the children with disabilities and their families. The data will also be fed back to non-government organisations, the Ministrys of Health, Education and Social Services who support children with disabilities in Kenya.",

      "Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) causes 1 million deaths in children annually by making children susceptible to common infections.  The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that children with SAM should receive antibiotics together with nutritional rehabilitation. Children with SAM and complications including signs of infection or severe metabolic disturbance are referred for hospital admission. However, most admissions with SAM present directly to hospital because of severe illness, and their SAM is only detected during clinical assessment. At the four hospital sites for the proposed trial, between 15% and 18% of paediatric admissions between the ages of 2 and 59 months have SAM. In sub-Saharan Africa, up to 30% of children admitted to hospital with complicated SAM die, usually from severe infection. Mortality is highest amongst those who also have HIV infection.  There are reports that bacteria isolated from children with SAM, when tested in the laboratory, are often not susceptible to the recommended first-line antibiotics. In Kenya we have conducted long term surveillance of bacterial infections. Amongst children with SAM, non-susceptibility has risen:  in the last 5 years, more than one third of bacteria isolated at admission to hospital are non-susceptible to the recommended antibiotics. Because children with SAM are vulnerable to infection, this to result in death rather than simply a prolonged hospital stay.  An alternative antibiotic, ceftriaxone, is cheaper the currently recommended combination and only has to be given once a day instead of four times. Much less resistance to ceftriaxone is reported. Ceftriaxone would be used as first line treatment if such a child were admitted to hospital in the UK. At first sight, it seems that ceftriaxone would be a more appropriate antibiotic, and it could reduce deaths. However, a significant concern is that ceftriaxone is known to rapidly induce resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics. This could mean that subsequent infections could be harder, and more expensive, to treat. Furthermore, studies have not shown a clear relationship between laboratory susceptibility testing and actual outcomes. In determining policy for empiric antimicrobials for this vulnerable population, potential benefits of reduced mortality, quicker recovery and reduced costs must be weighed against potential risks of infections that are difficult and expensive to treat. There is currently no evidence to inform this decision.  A second question in the antibiotic treatment of SAM is the value of metronidazole. Current WHO guidelines suggest that metronidazole may be optionally used although it has never been tested in a clinical trial. It is effective against bacteria that cause abnormal overgrowth in the small bowel, and against gut parasites such as Giardia. These conditions are common amongst children with SAM and may cause malabsorption of nutrients and diarrhoea. Treating them improve nutritional recovery. Results of small studies suggest this may be the case. However, metronidazole can cause nausea, vomiting and other toxicities which could impede nutritional recovery.   We propose an efficiently designed trial to test both ceftriaxone and of metronidazole against standard care for the outcomes of mortality and nutritional recovery. First we will determine the optimal dosing for the drugs in malnourished children. We will carefully investigate children for infections and the antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated determined. An economic analysis will measure the cost-benefit ratio of each strategy and overall costs of treatment for SAM. The trial will be run at 2 rural and 2 urban hospitals in Kenya. The results are expected to have direct impact on antibiotic policy for the management of SAM in hospitals in Africa and will provide unique information that will contribute to global efforts to combat the threat of antimicrobial resistance.",

      "Despite remarkable progress achieved in decreasing HIV transmission and AIDS-related deaths in the last decade due to development of over 30 antiretroviral drugs, HIV continues to spread in a virtually uncontrolled manner. An effective HIV vaccine remains one of the priorities of HIV/AIDS research and will always be the best solution and likely key to any strategy for halting the AIDS epidemic. The biggest challenge in developing such a vaccine is the enormous HIV variability, which dwarfs that of any other virus except hepatitis C virus. However, all parts of HIV cannot easily change; to remain alive, HIV has to keep some smaller regions of its proteins more or less constant to maintain function. Our vaccine strategy takes advantage of this and focuses the body defenses on these conserved parts of HIV, its Achilles heel. Because conserved regions are common to most of the global HIV variants, the vaccine, if successful, could be used in Africa, Asia, Europe, America and Australia: it would be universal. The 1st generation conserved-region vaccine was very safe and induced strong immune responses in adult volunteers in the UK and Africa. In 2014, the pharmaceutical company GSK acquired a small biotech company, which developed one of the benign viruses we used for vaccine delivery, and unilaterally decided that we could no longer use the jointly owned vaccine in high risk people. Thus we needed to switch to an alternative vaccine virus and this provided an opportunity to also substantially improve the 1st generation vaccine.  These modifications are based on our experience from human vaccine testing and other developments in the HIV vaccine field over the last 10 years since its original design. Thus, the 2nd generation vaccine was born, using a new vaccine virus (ChAdOx1) owned by Oxford University and combining conserved regions with computer-designed proteins (mosaics), which significantly increase the vaccine match to global HIV variants. (Note that even the highly conserved regions are still somewhat variable.) Vaccines should match circulating HIVs as much as possible to stop them efficiently. The 2nd generation vaccines have been constructed, shown to induce strong immune responses in animal models and are now bound for testing in human volunteers. The requested funds will allow to us see how well the 2nd generation vaccine works in trying to get rid of HIV from already infected individuals and for larger scale testing in HIV-1 negative healthy volunteers in Africa. The latter study will aim first evidence that the vaccine can stop HIV from infecting healthy people. The funding will also allow clinical testing of the vaccine enabling further improvements including some new aimed at keeping ahead of HIV.",

      "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major pathogen worldwide, causing progressive and often severe liver disease in the estimated 160 million people infected with the virus. In the UK, a substantial proportion of the estimated 350,000 individuals chronically infected with HCV will eventually develop cirrhosis and liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma; HCC) if left untreated. While there is treatment available, conventional therapies based on interferon are effective in only a proportion of those treated while more recently developed antiviral therapy that directly targets the virus is expensive and its use will remain cost-limited for many years. Importantly, such treatments will not stem the spread of HCV and the large numbers of new infections recorded every year; even those who have been effectively treated remain prone to re-infection. HCV also poses a much greater medical problem worldwide where access to treatment will remain limited in much the same as HIV therapy. HCV-related deaths worldwide exceed 350,000 per year, of the same order to those attributed to AIDS, TB and malaria.   Large scale immunisation with a safe and effective HCV vaccine would induce life-long immunity to HCV and prevent further spread of the virus to those currently at risk for infection. Secondly, the therapeutic use of a vaccine in which immunisation would control and clear infection in those already infected with HCV would prevent and in many cases reverse development of liver disease complications, such as cirrhosis and HCC associated with long term chronic infection. The development of such vaccines would therefore have profound effects on global health.   The development of HCV vaccine has been hampered by a lack of animal models with which to test different type of vaccine. It has also proven exceptionally difficult to develop vaccines that induce long-lived protective immunity - even clearance of natural infections does not protect from subsequent re-infection, quite unlike the situation of poliovirus, measles and hepatitis A virus (as examples) for which effective vaccines have been developed.   We believe the solution to the problems is to generate novel vaccines in which viral proteins, such as those from HCV, are inserted into another virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV) or adenovirus (AdV). A feature of CMV infections is that although harmless, infection leads invariably to persistent infections. Infections with CMV containing inserted HCV genes, once established, would therefore continuously immunise the body against HCV, much more so than infection with HCV itself. The most compelling evidence for the effectiveness of this method of immunisation arises from HIV vaccine research, where CMV vectors were effective at preventing infection of macaques with SIV, a monkey version of HIV. Furthermore, the CMV/SIV vaccine was able to clear infection from macaques already infected with SIV. A human version of this CMV vaccine, containing HIV genes, is currently entering human clinical trial. AdV-vectored vaccines for HCV have proven efficacy in animal models and are currently in human phase I/II clinical trial.   The other development that will enable us to develop an effective HCV vaccine is the very recent discovery of a virus called rodent hepacivirus (RHV), closely related to HCV, that infects rats and causes the same pattern of liver disease and frequency of persistence as HCV in humans. In our planned project, we will develop CMV and AdV vectors containing genes from RHV to directly evaluate whether this approach can generate protective immunity and can clear RHV infection in rats that are chronically infected with the virus. Based on previous experience with CMV/SIV vaccine candidates in macaques, we believe this strategy will also prove effective for HCV and if confirmed, could translate through very rapidly into human clinical trials.",

      "Excess body fat is a major cause of diabetes, heart attacks and strokes, worldwide. Body-mass index (BMI; defined as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) is the basis of the World Health Organisation's definition of overweight and obesity, with a BMI of between 25 and 30 kg/m2 classified as overweight, and over 30 kg/m2 as obese. However, there is increasing evidence that levels of body fat for a given BMI may vary between populations, raising questions regarding universally applied BMI-based guidelines for overweight and obesity. Although BMI is frequently used in Malaysia to assess excess body fat, there have been no large-scale imaging studies with direct measurements of body fat and its distribution which would allow us to understand better the relationship between body composition and disease outcomes in this population.   From 2006-2012, The Malaysia Cohort study - initiated by the Malaysian government - recruited 106,527 adults aged 35 years or over. Participants completed a lifestyle questionnaire, underwent physical measurements, provided a blood sample and are now being followed for health events. In 6000 of The Malaysia Cohort participants, we will conduct whole-body Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) imaging (which provides data on body fat distribution in addition to body fat percentage) using protocols established by the UK Biobank (a large cohort study co-ordinated by the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford). This imaging sub-study will significantly enhance this national biomedical resource.  Using DXA imaging, this study will reliably assess the relationship between conventional measures for estimating body composition (including BMI, waist circumference and waist-hip ratio) with the absolute regional fat masses derived from the DXA measurements in the Malaysian population. It will then assess the relationship between these measures and risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, to inform public health guidance on the appropriate measure of excess body fat in this population, the ideal 'normal' range of these measures, and whether guidance should vary for the different ethnic groups in Malaysia. DXA imaging will also significantly enhance the potential of The Malaysia Cohort to investigate the genetic and environmental determinants of obesity in Malaysia, and the biological pathways through which it causes diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  Not all people who are overweight or obese suffer adverse consequence from their excess weight, in part due to differences in fat distribution. Indeed, as recently reported from The Malaysia Cohort, the prevalence of obesity (based on BMI) and type 2 diabetes is very divergent between the major ethnic groups in Malaysia (Malay, Indian and Chinese) and this is only partly explained by BMI. Therefore, a better understanding of the between-ethnic group risk, based on tissue and organ-specific fat depots, will enable more precise targeting of limited resources to those who will gain the most benefit.",

      "Diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were ranked 5th and 7th leading cause of mortality in Thailand by the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015. An estimated 3.2 Thai adults (6.4% of the adult population) had diabetes in 2013, expected to grow to 5.2 million by 2035. Treatment of advanced kidney failure by dialysis is expensive, costing about 3.6% of the Thai healthcare budget in 2011, projected to increase to 6.2% by the year 2018. If detected early, this complication can be prevented in a majority.   Despite the implementation of universal health coverage in Thailand, the health care systems - particularly those serving rural populations - remain poorly equipped to manage diabetes because doctors are in short supply and there are few organised diabetes programmes. This is especially true for diabetes-related kidney disease. Therefore, alternative methods of detecting and managing diabetes in rural areas are urgently required. One potential method is to use a more widely available health care workforce such as village health workers. These workers are not medically qualified but have received health training workers and could potentially be used to deliver more effective care. This study will develop and assess a strategy called 'SMART Health' to use non-physician healthcare workers to identify and manage village residents with diabetes and kidney disease according to best practice. Healthcare workers will be trained to use a simple mobile device (tablet or smartphone) on which they can record patient data such as age, weight, blood pressure, family history and receive immediate advice about how to treat the patient with drugs and/or lifestyle advice generated by an electronic program. This program considers the patient's risk factors and stage of disease and generates recommendations based on national treatment guidelines. The program also links with the patient's personal health record so that they can be followed up or referred to hospitals as appropriate.  The study will have 2 phases. In the first phase, we will develop and test the electronic programmes or 'algorithms' to detect and manage diabetes ensuring that the recommendations are appropriate and in line with the facilities and resources (including affordable medicines) available. In the second phase, we measure the effectiveness of SMART Health Diabetes in a large trial which compares 20 villages who have been trained to use and have access to SMART Health Diabetes ('intervention' villages) with 20 villages who do not have SMART Health Diabetes but will continue their usual practice ('control' villages). We will then compare individuals from intervention and villages in terms important diabetes-related outcomes such as glucose control and kidney damage. In parallel, we will conduct economic assessments and interviews with health workers to determine whether SMART Health Diabetes is cost-effective and acceptable.  We will work with village leaders, government organisations and professional groups to make sure the study is relevant and appropriate. By working with these groups, we will also ensure that SMART Health Diabetes can be used more widely in routine diabetes care if proven to be effective and safe.",

      "In thirty years' time there will be half a billion adolescents in Africa. Like youth everywhere, they possess huge potential to thrive. But more than half are trapped in cycles of poor nutrition, poverty, low education, violence and unemployment. They also have the world's highest rates of early fertility, with adverse long-term outcomes for adolescent parents and their children. Such inter-generational disadvantage creates risks not only in the region but also to global stability.  The SDGs and African Union's Agenda 2063 challenge us to take a radical new approach. The UK's Global Challenges Research Fund provides a unique opportunity to do this. The Accelerating Advantage Hub will find the combinations of services with the greatest positive impacts for Africa's adolescents and their children. We need to move beyond services focused on single outcomes, towards 'super-accelerator' impacts across multiple SDGs of health, education, violence prevention, gender equality and economic stability. With our government partners we will test combination services - for example of cash transfers, malaria prophylaxis, parenting programs, business skills and violence prevention - to identify the leanest and most effective policy packages.  The Hub has been planned with African governments and international agencies including the UN Development Program, African Union, UNICEF and the World Health Organisation. They have told us that 'evidence as usual' is not enough. When we make a personal investment, like buying a computer, we want to know not only whether it is the most efficient, but also whether it is good value for money and whether we will like to use it. Governments need the same information about services: their effectiveness, their cost-effectiveness, whether they can be delivered through existing health, education and welfare systems, and whether they will be accepted by service providers and by adolescents. The Hub will conduct large-scale studies and use existing data in Angola, Cote D'Ivoire, DRC, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia & Zimbabwe. All projects will include cost-effectiveness to assist budget decisions. In short, we will provide African policy-makers with the evidence they need and want to do the best for adolescents.  The Hub will also train and support frontline workers to improve services for adolescents across Africa. We will turn evidence into training modules, freely accessible manuals and support materials. We will deliver practitioner training in 34 African countries by working with NGO partners selected for wide regional coverage, for example Paediatric Adolescent Treatment for Africa, the International Rescue Committee, Clowns without Borders and the International AIDS Alliance. Skills-building for young researchers in Africa and the UK is built into the Hub's work. We will support 45 promising young academics and dedicated African policymakers to focus their careers on improving the lives of adolescents and their children.  The Hub's work is planned with adolescents themselves. Too many services have failed because they do not appeal to teenagers' aspirations and immediate goals. The Hub will work directly with adolescent advisory groups in Eastern, Western and Southern Africa to co-develop approaches that are not only effective, but also meaningful and fun for those who will use them.  We aim to reach 20 million adolescents and their children with effective combinations of services to meet their needs. Between our direct countries of research and our NGO partners, the Hub will actively engage with policymakers, practitioners and adolescents across East, West, Southern and Central Africa and including fragile and war-torn states. We have a common goal: to transform the potential of Africa's adolescents into a thriving future for the continent.",

      "The 2017 Lancet Series, Advancing Early Childhood Development: From Science to Scale, estimated that 43% of children under 5 years in LMICs (250m children), were at risk of not reaching their potential because they had stunted linear growth or lived in extreme poverty. The proportion of children at risk increases appreciably when additional risk factors are considered, especially low maternal schooling and child maltreatment. Living in poor and unstimulating conditions affects young children's learning and development. Children exposed to poverty and adversity explore and learn less than children not exposed to these stresses; they learn less at school and achieve fewer school grades; earn less as adults; have more social problems, and poorer physical and mental health. We will study barriers and accelerators to learning in LMIC ECE programmes, at home and in communities, as well as associations between early learning and indicators of child development and  school performance. We will estimate their longer-term effects on education and earnings in adulthood. We will use descriptive and statistical analyses of secondary data collected through representative country surveys and research studies. As an established group of multi-disciplinary and multi-country experts and collaborators, we build on prior success in sourcing and analysing data from 91 LMICs by including early education and expanding to 137 countries. Global data, presented along the continuum of the early years, breaks down the false dichotomy between ECD and ECE, between care and education, and between learning at home and in formal programmes, and supports multi-sectoral actions along different stages of the life-course. We will expand our global analyses of threats to ECD by examining gender, location and wealth, services and family supports for young children, and policies that create facilitating environments for families and children. We will, for the first time, link indicators of the structural quality of ECE (eg teacher-child ratios) to contexts and child outcomes in LMICs. Process quality (eg teacher- and caregiver-child interactions), on which there is as yet no global data, will be studied through case studies in 5 countries, one in each of five regions of the world. We will source data on government, development assistance and household expenditures on pre-primary education; extract further country micro-data on contexts in which young children develop and learn; update nationally representative data on young children, services and policies to the most recent survey dates available, and develop new composite indicators of barriers and accelerators of young children's learning and development. Through partnerships with regional networks of ECD-ECE government and stakeholder teams, the project will help to build research capacity in ECD-ECE, and increase the use of data for decision-making, action and monitoring in 20 countries. We will use the results to provide evidence-based support to engage international human rights law, especially the right to education and the rights of the child, in advancing progress towards achieving the SDG goals of universal access by 2030. This research will address the gap in the evidence base for a unified approach to ECD and ECE. The findings will support the development of the right to education by providing a holistic approach to guide early development and educational interventions. It will demonstrate the strength of interdisciplinary work in cross-fertilizing data analysis and legal research in building strong foundations for translation into policy and regulatory change. Given the evidence on the critical roles of ECD-ECE on learning and wellbeing in the short, medium and longer term, the project has important implications for development and welfare in countries on the DAC list. This large-scale global approach is critical to support and guide policy and investments.",

      "Vision: SAPPHIRE is a UK-African research and training partnership which will build capacity in Africa to obtain better fault information of M-LINACs and to feed into an M-LINAC tailored to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Importance: Our previous STFC funded ITAR project surveyed 28 African countries, revealing two major challenges: 1) many African M-LINACs suffer from considerable down-time down due to frequent breakdowns of specific components; and 2) a shortfall exists in radiotherapy workforce, especially trained physicists. Team: We will bring together M-LINAC facilities in Accra and Kumasi (Ghana) and Pretoria (South Africa), two STFC accelerator centres in Oxford & Lancaster, and medical physics expertise from Cambridge in partnership with CERN and ICEC. Our global team has decades of experience in accelerator and M-LINAC research and has engaged in collaboration with African partners since 2010. Areas of Focus: Specific focus will be given to post-acceleration beam-shaping systems that match radiation beam to tumour target (i.e. multi-leaf collimator devices). MLCs are prone to frequent breakdowns. Project SAPPHIRE has 3 key objectives: Objective 1: To identify junior physicists in Africa to train in electronic data collection and analysis of usage and fault data from M-LINAC stock in their own centres. Objective 2: To use gathered data to assess the effect of faults and to define MLC tolerances, studying different candidate leaf designs for an improved and robust MLC unit. Objective 3: To compare the performance of candidate designs with current-generation commercial M-LINAC devices for treatment planning using real-world clinical data. We will achieve these objectives through four key Physics Education And Research Linkage work packages (PEARLs): PEARL-1 Data Capture. We will create a solution for electronic data capture (EDC) of M-LINAC fault and usage data, enhanced with key environmental factors (e.g. operating temperature, voltage stability, humidity and atmospheric particulate levels). Hasford, Addison and Nethwadzi will supervise training of junior physicists for EDC work in Ghana and South Africa. PEARL-2 MLC Improvements. Dosanjh, Burt, Addison, Hasford and Nethwadzi will develop an understanding of the causes of MLC faults, analyse the implications on the radiation patterns using Geant4 and develop improvements of the MLC design. This will allow researchers throughout our collaboration to investigate the relationship between reported fault and environmental data and the design constraints of the MLC. PEARL-3 Training workshops. Burt, Dosanjh, Jena, Ayette, Addison, Grover, Hasford, and Nethwadzi will establish two physics schools in Africa, first one in Ghana focussing on LINACs, their sub-components and faults/maintenance of those system and the second in Pretoria focussing on radiation physics simulations and imaging and treatment planning. PEARL-4 Treatment planning. Jena, Dosanjh, Ayette and Grover, will compare the performance of candidate hardware designs with current-generation commercial M-LINAC devices in a suite of treatment planning tasks typical of today’s clinical demands. Pathway to success: 1) We have a rich and capable multi-professional team and a long track record of successful collaboration. 2) We will make lasting impact through successful upskilling of junior physics staff in Africa, to perform better research and development in M-LINAC component design and operational robustness. 3) Data from SAPPHIRE will be used by our global consortium (ICEC) to design and deploy a novel fault tolerant M-LINAC design for LMICs by 2030.",

      "For several complex pathogens, we have an incomplete understanding of the kind of immune response we need an effective vaccine to induce. In part this is because these pathogens live inside cells and can hide from the host immune response. This makes it very difficult to develop vaccines against these pathogens. The diseases caused by these pathogens, including tuberculosis (TB), leprosy, leishmaniasis and melioidosis, disproportionately affect people in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) and are often neglected due to the poor predicted commercial return and marginalisation of affected populations. The current approach to vaccine development is to identify a part of the immune response that might be important, develop vaccines that induce that kind of immune response and then test that vaccine to see if it works, first in animal models and then in human clinical trials. This approach does not work for these complex pathogens and is slow and inefficient. In this Network we will adopt an iterative approach and develop more accurate working models of the immune response by cycles of repeated integration of data from human clinical studies and animal models across the different pathogens. The inclusion of vets working in large animal models will mean the results obtained are relevant for the development of animal vaccines as well. The inclusion of partners from LMIC where these diseases are endemic, together with partners from industry will help ensure real world relevance. Furthermore, the smaller animal models will allow us to easily look at single components of the immune system. The insight gained into immune mechanisms will allow us to design and develop vaccines more efficiently and more effectively.   This Network will provide a unique opportunity to bring together individuals working on four exemplar complex intracellular pathogens (M.tb, M.leprae, Leishmania spp. and B.pseudomallei), which share a common lifestyle as pathogens that live in a particular host cell called macrophages, induce similar end-stage pathologies in humans and are known to affect host immune and metabolic responses. The horizontal collaborations established throughout this network, together with the provision of a protected environment for early data sharing, will exploit the biological synergies between these pathogens. Positive and negative results can be disseminated rapidly, and partners working on each of the complex diseases can learn from the successes and failures of those working on the other diseases. By understanding mechanisms that lead from infection to disease, we plan to uncover common approaches to inform vaccine development strategies for these and other complex intracellular pathogens.   Key Network activities and deliverables include annual meetings for knowledge sharing; creation of a virtual network for real-time data sharing; pump-priming funding to fill knowledge gaps, and provide data to enhance the competitiveness of larger grant applications; a website and other communications to enhance collaborations and research dissemination; and career development by funding, training and mentoring of early post-doctoral and new PI researchers. All activities work towards more effective vaccine development for these important diseases, and the improvement of research capabilities in our partner LMICs.",

      "In Vietnam, surveillance data showed alarmingly high and increasing drug-resistant proportions of important pathogens in hospitals. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) has been an important national strategy to improve antibiotic use, however, implementation has been slow at resource-limited hospitals due to lack of resources, skills and capacity. These include district hospitals, the first-point of hospitalization in the public healthcare system where first intravenous antibiotics are usually given empirically in the absence of microbiology lab services. Connecting with provincial-level hospitals through AMS networks is therefore a potential approach to support district hospitals in accessing external available resources for AMS implementation. In this proposed four-year research project, Oxford University Clinical Research Unit Vietnam (OUCRU) and National Hospital for Tropical Diseases will work with two hospital networks in a participatory action research approach to 1) to evaluate the effectiveness, costs and implementation outcomes of AMS programmes delivered through the two local networks, 2) to develop staff capacity in provincial and district hospitals in AMS implementation through participatory action research and network involvement, and 3) to explore opportunities for and contextual factors to support effective implementation of AMS programmes in these AMS hospital networks. Each hospital network will consist of one provincial hospital and five connecting district hospitals identified based on our previous research and the commitment of hospital leadership and AMS staff. Hospital AMS staff (participants) will be involved in an iterative reflective cycle where they will collect and analyse data and determine actions and interventions to implement, observe the process, and reflect and evaluate the outcomes to inform continuing actions. The research team will train hospital staff on AMS related skills and research methods to collect and analyse data, assess and identify interventions, develop and evaluate the implementation. Hospital staff will use evidence and guidance from national guidelines and World Health Organisation's toolkit to identify possible interventions and make hospital-specific action plans contextualized to their local conditions. Results and learning experience will be shared and discussed in regular hospital team meetings and network meetings facilitated by the researchers. We will use a mixed methods design throughout the research including staff survey, interviews and focus group discussions to understand the process, assess implementation aspects including costs, feasibility, acceptability, sustainability and scalability, and explore opportunities and contextual factors for AMS implementation based on the network approach. Longitudinal routine data will be extracted from hospital information systems to evaluate co-primary outcome measures of antibiotic use and clinical outcomes (in-hospital mortality and length of stay). We will also conduct a survey of 2000 patients in all hospitals at two time points, before and 12 months after implementation started, to investigate the potential impact of AMS on colonization of drug-resistant bacteria. Evidence generated from this research will be important for policy makers and hospitals in resource-limited settings like Vietnam in developing and implementing locally adapted AMS programmes. This research will also build the capacity and ownership of local hospitals and their staff in assessing, planning, implementing and evaluating their AMS interventions, and increase the capacity of research staff in implementation science and engaging local partners through the participatory action research process. Local AMS networks will be developed and strengthened to increase resource mobilization, motivation and participation of hospitals in the implementation.",

      "Multiple large-scale forest restoration strategies are emerging globally to counteract ecosystems degradation and biodiversity loss. However, these strategies often remain insufficient to offset the loss caused by anthropogenic development. At least two reasons could explain this incomplete performance: i) we ignore how human disturbance affects species genetic variability and their potential to evolve and adapt to the ongoing global changes; ii) there is a major gap in the knowledge about long-term (>100 years) ecosystem dynamics after human disturbance ends. In this project, we propose to investigate the adaptative potential of the Brazil nut and other Amazonian tree crops associated with Brazil nut areas, after anthropic disturbance cessation. We will sample plant leaf and cambium tissue and roots on Pre-Columbian archaeological sites, today known as Terras Pretas Amazônicas (TPA), where the descendants of ancient Brazilian nut trees still grow today. With selected TPA sites sequentially abandoned that have never been reoccupied, we will build a 2,000-year chronosequence. This chronosequence will allow us understand how the Brazilian nut trees and associated Amazonian tree crops recover their adaptive potential after they are released from domestication after Pre-Columbian peoples sequentially abandoned their lands to finally collapse around the XV century with the Spanish invasion. Our team that includes experts in forest restoration, domestication, and genomics will explore changes in the whole genome of the Brazilian nut tree and associated tree crops, as well as its associated soil microbiome, along the chronosequence. The results will help find genomes with increased genetic variability and thus adaptive potential, by identifying specific functions related to an enhanced adaptive potential. Propagules from individuals with these functions can then be used in tropical forest restoration, and agriculture, increasing the resilience and resistance of forests to ongoing global changes.",
