This means that the country cooperation strategies and country support plans will have clear actions, measure results in every country and provide resources where needed. Furthermore, the Secretariat will work with Member States and non-State actors on country-specific priorities in order to achieve GPW 13.\nThe Secretariat will engage all countries in strategic, advocacy and policy dialogue, based on high-quality data and projections, in order to highlight how specific changes in policy could affect their health outcomes. In particular, the Secretariat will further develop and help implement the proposed Universal Health and Preparedness Review.\nReinforced by the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All, the Secretariat will work with Member States and non-State actors to ensure that WHO helps Member States to advance towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. This means that country cooperation strategies that are based on the national priorities, policies and plans and are in line with United Nations reform will be guided by GPW 13 and oriented towards the Sustainable Development Goals.\nUnder the Global Action Plan, the Secretariat will facilitate and enhance collaboration among the 12 agencies that play key roles in health, development and humanitarian response in order to accelerate progress on the health-related Sustainable Development Goals targets, including by hosting the Global Action Plan secretariat and providing leadership on its various inter-agency accelerator groups at the global level.\nThe Secretariat, through the aligned work of the three levels of the Organization, will lead the effort to convert the commitment of leading health and development organizations to work more closely together, as set out in the Global Action Plan, to take collective action in support of the implementation of national priorities in order to accelerate progress towards the health-related Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe Secretariat will promote more effective leadership at all levels, including by strengthening country office leadership, developing a fit-for-purpose staffing structure, providing appropriate delegation of authority and re-engineering business processes that facilitate effectiveness and efficiency.\nThe Secretariat will increase its internal capacity for health diplomacy, strengthen coherence in its external relations and increase its support for Member State delegations in the area of health diplomacy and participation in governing body meetings.\nThe Secretariat will convene the governing bodies in a manner that aligns the WHO work agenda with the Sustainable Development Goals through effective and efficient processes, including the design and application of innovative solutions to support the preparation and delivery of meetings of the governing bodies. In addition, it will implement the outcomes of ongoing Member State consultations on governance reform in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner, applying the lessons learned from governing body processes, including in respect of special procedures for conducting ?virtual? and ?hybrid? meetings and novel agenda management modalities.\nThe Secretariat will bring a gender perspective to leadership and governance and encourage the participation of young people. It will provide effective support to governing body sessions, with efficient and aligned agendas that are focused on the Sustainable Development Goals and United Nations reform.",

The Secretariat will focus on: \nstrengthening the transparency and accountability of the Organization and its leadership; \nembedding a victim- and survivor-centred approach across the safeguarding cycle; \ninstitutionalizing safeguarding from sexual misconduct in all relevant policies, procedures, and practices; \nigniting and sustaining cultural change across the Organization;\nprioritizing high-risk situations ? emergencies and other community-facing operations;\nstrengthening systems to identify and manage the risk of sexual misconduct; \nbuilding capacity and expertise for preventing of and responding to sexual misconduct; \nfully implementing the end-to-end sexual misconduct incident management system; and\ntaking system-wide action with UN and humanitarian stakeholders, governments and civil society; and\ndeveloping and implementing systems for monitoring and evaluation and course correction.\n\nThe Secretariat will continue to enhance its capacity for audits and investigations, including the capacity to respond to audit observations at the country level, particularly in country offices based in challenging operating environments. \nIn the context of the investigation of allegations of suspected misconduct, the Office of Internal Oversight will implement revised policies and procedures to reflect best-in-class practices and strengthen resources to improve the timeliness of the processing of cases and justice for those involved.\nFurthermore, the evaluation policy (2018) will continue to inform evaluation functions, the strengthening of which will be guided by further mandates from the governing bodies. This will be guided by best-in-class studies and a framework for decentralized evaluations. The Secretariat will continue to participate in inter-agency evaluations in areas of shared substantive and strategic interest.\nThe Secretariat will continue to conduct due diligence and risk assessments in accordance with the Framework of Engagement with Non-State Actors, further strengthening the capacity of staff members to engage more while managing risks, including for sexual misconduct.",

WHO will continue working with its partners in animal health, mainly the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Organisation for Animal Health, to support countries in developing capacities at the human?animal interface. The COVID-19 pandemic and other recent outbreaks have again underlined this urgent need;\nidentify gaps in national capabilities to collect, analyse and report data related to the International Health Regulations (2005) and other data, which will inform capacity strengthening for health security and preparedness. To facilitate capacity strengthening, WHO will undertake to map all domestic and internationally available technical and financial resources that can be used for national and regional health security preparedness. In order to address identified gaps in preparedness, the Secretariat will support countries to develop, cost, finance and integrate national disease or hazard-specific preparedness plans (including for the COVID-19 pandemic response) with broader and comprehensive national action plans for health security and health sector plans, working with donors to reduce duplication, enhance efficiencies and build sustainability, including through the development of national investment cases for preparedness;\nensure progress and collaboration, and periodically realign resources with gaps through processes and tools, including resource mapping to support the evaluation process for national action plans for health security, and WHO?s Strategic Partnership Portal for health security, which supports countries, partners and donors in aligning their investments with the plans for strengthening health security. This will require regular monitoring with the engagement of stakeholders; and\nscale up preparedness in special contexts, including urban settings, small island developing States, overseas territories and conflict settings. WHO?s regional offices will play a leading role in this. Regional and country offices will also lead efforts to foster engagement with non-traditional health stakeholders, including parliamentarians, ministries of finance, ministries of foreign affairs, community leaders, sporting organizations and faith-based organizations, to build a multisectoral, whole-of-society approach to emergency preparedness and capacity-building.",
