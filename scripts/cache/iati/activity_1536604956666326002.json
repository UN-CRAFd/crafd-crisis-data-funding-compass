Component 1 will target Global Knowledge TA work through the establishment of a high-level Green Hydrogen Development Facility (Green Hydrogen Facility) that will serve as a global platform to disseminate best practices and facilitate global knowledge exchange to raise awareness between public and private sector stakeholders on different green hydrogen technology applications and policy solutions. Component 2 will target the development/operationalization of emerging green hydrogen opportunities through first-of-a-kind projects in 4 countries, namely, Chile, Morocco, Tunisia, and Ukraine to fast-track public-private investment mobilization for green hydrogen project development.\n\nOverall, the project will aim to promote policy innovations to support green hydrogen technology development and transfer in order to reduce global green house gas (GHG) emissions, which closely aligns with the GEF-7 Climate Change Mitigation (CCM) Focal Area objectives. As such, the project will focus on multiple policy, strategy, and  technology application use cases of green hydrogen across sectors starting in the power sector from long-duration storage and the integration of renewables to hard-to-abate heavy industry (cement, chemicals, steele, etc.) solutions. In addition, the proposal will focus on green hydrogen solutions across other key sectors such as transport (long-distance trucking, shipping, and aviation) and agriculture (ammonia production) including the building sector.",

Instead, through the coordination, knowledge exchange and technical support it provides, it will facilitate and enhance the achievement of socioeconomic benefits in the 15 national projects. The achievement of meaningful socioeconomic benefits forms an integral part of the GEF-8 GWP, reflected in program component 3. Technical support needed for this program component is included in Output 2.4. The technical and knowledge support needs of the national projects to generate socioeconomic benefits have been considered in the development of this coordination project and will be adapted as needed during project implementation to reflect the needs of projects.  Socioeconomic benefits will be monitored and reported on via the GWP program-level M&amp;E framework (see Annex L). Relevant program indicators include indicator 3.3.1.  Number of countries and/or communities with new and/or strengthened arrangements related to ownership, access, or use rights of Indigenous Peoples, and of local communities; and indicator 3.4.1.  Number of community members (sex disaggregated) economically benefiting from wildlife economy through i) new jobs created; ii) increased income; iii) new enterprises/business created or supported; and iv) other diversified livelihood opportunities. The coordination project will aggregate and report progress towards these as part of program-level M&amp;E reporting."

      "To increase national and regional capacity and coordination among ASL stakeholders and partners for improved integrated landscape management and conservation in targeted areas in the Amazon.",
      "Note: Disbursement data provided is cumulative and covers disbursement made by the project Agency.",
      "The ASL3 Program’s environmental and social impacts overall are deemed to be positive, and negative environmental impacts are expected to be nil, or minimal, localized, and reversible. The Program will generate social benefits in critical aspects that influence well-being such as food security, health, and recovery of traditional knowledge, and at the same time, it will have an impact on better practices for conserving biodiversity and ecosystem resilience over generations. The Regional TA, focusing on knowledge management and cooperation, will not implement activities on the ground and as such very few environmental and social risks are associated with it. The main instruments of the Regional TA to guide its implementation, limiting risks are the Stakeholder Engagement Plan, the Gender plan and the associated Grievance Redress Mechanism, in which efforts to respect and promote Indigenous Peoples and other vulnerable communities as well as women and youth are described.  In regards to the ASL national projects, any E&amp;S risks will be mitigated through proper safeguard/standard instruments and procedures according to each GEF agency. The Program will facilitate, as needed, knowledge exchange and dialogue between projects in matters related to compliance with social and environmental safeguards and standards.Additional Summary on Risks:The risks to the implementation of the Regional TA and their mitigation strategy include:(i)         Increase in the number of countries participating in the ASL Program: Venezuela is joining the ASL, and thus all 8 sovereign countries of the Amazon will participate in the Program. Coordination and prioritization of activities with a larger number of stakeholders will be a new challenge. Continuous engagement with new members, and the previous experience from the addition of 4 more countries between ASL1 and ASL2, result in rating this as a low risk.(ii)       Differing needs from the national projects and readiness to initiate regional activities: While all the national projects are aligned to the ASL Theory of Change, there is heterogeneity in their activities, due to different contexts and priorities. In addition, as in ASL2, it is likely that not all 8 national projects will start at the same time and their implementation pace will also differ. Guyana for instance was included 6 months after the other national projects with an amended PFD and approved by GEF Council in December 2023. Negotiation processes between the executing and implementing agencies differ, resulting in different timelines. Those differences will mean that their needs related to the Regional TA may not coincide. The mitigation measures include the design and planning of regional activities so that they may start when enough projects are ready, or with a subgroup of countries that then expands, and that they adapt to respond to different stages of the projects.(iii)      Contrasting Government policies: The delivery of the knowledge exchange and coordination activities could be affected by different approaches to deforestation and other environmental and development issues in the countries. Experience from previous phases with different governments and political spectrums will facilitate managing the risk. In addition, the Belem Declaration and renewed efforts to strengthen ACTO have put regional coordination at the forefront of national agendas and the ASL will use its shared vision to lead countries toward common activities. Conflict over disputed areas between Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela could bring tension over cartographic data. Updated guidance and advice from the World Bank will mitigate the risk or at least inform the team on how to address related issues. The Regional TA will abide by the disclaimer, which states that the boundaries, colors, denominations, and any other information shown on maps prepared by the institution do not imply, on the part of the World Bank, any judgment on the legal status of any territory, or any endorsement or acceptance of such boundaries.Government changes: The ASL has seen many elections and other government changes since its inception in 2015 that affected its preparation and implementation, slowing the pace of implementation and delaying some activities at regional level that required decisions from national governments. Mitigation measures include working with technical staff, as well as with regional/state governors and municipalities, which will also generate longer term commitments, and offset risks from potential political changes at the national level. There is also a need to reach out and inform new national-level staff on the Program. An orientation package has been designed and submitted to all new members of the PSC to inform about the program. Engagement with other types of stakeholders such as the private sector, scientists, and international NGOs also ensures continuation of the Program by including different types of interests in the ASL Program. During implementation of ASL3, similar approaches will be used whenever changes in government staff take place."

      "The platform has thoroughly considered the socio-economic benefits to be delivered by the project, and these have been clearly described in the Project Description. The project aims to integrate gender equality into all phases, promote urban spaces that enhance women's health and economic opportunities, and ensure that 50% of project beneficiaries are women. Additionally, the project will support integrated urban planning, nature-positive, climate-resilient, and carbon-neutral urban development. The socio-economic benefits include strengthening local institutional capacity, fostering knowledge generation and sharing, and facilitating partnership building. The project will embed diverse infrastructure types—ecological, hydrological, and engineered—into urban resilience planning to deliver multi-dimensional benefits. This approach will enhance resilience, ensure sustainable outcomes, and drive project implementation through cross-cutting priorities such as financing and inclusion. The project will also focus on building circular economies in cities, emphasizing sustainable financing, job creation, resource efficiency, and increased revenue potential. These socio-economic benefits will be monitored and reported on during project implementation, ensuring that the project's impact on local communities is continuously assessed and optimized."

      "Note: Disbursement data provided is cumulative and covers disbursement made by the project Agency.",
      "The Project will benefit the regular users and employees of public buildings of ministries, other central and local government institutions, and public facilities. They will include the citizens of the participating countries who rely on services provided by retrofitted public buildings, such as school children, users of hospitals or clinics and critical services that will benefit from enhanced security against power outages. Taxpayers will also benefit, indirectly from the lower electricity bills of public services funded taxes. Ministries and local government offices can use the cost savings from reduced energy consumption for other public services. Additional beneficiaries will include professionals and skilled workers in engineering, equipment suppliers, installation, and other service providers for EE, RE services from increased demand for their goods and services across the region.      Furthermore, this WB CEGEB Regional Project will enable regional integration and multiply the benefits of a coordinated sustained development and maintenance of capacity at the regional level whilst giving individual countries the ability to pursue national-level activities best suited to their circumstances. Women seeking technical jobs in the energy sector will benefit too from support activities included in the Project designed to reduce the relatively low level of female employment in the energy sector’s technical jobs.  Additional economic benefits will result from: (i) economies of scale in procurement and transaction costs, (ii) expansion of the regional market for EE and solar PV equipment; (iii) creation of local jobs for installation, operation, and maintenance services of EE and DPV systems and (iii) development of a regional public good by knowledge-sharing in activities such as procurement, operations and maintenance, and capacity-building.         The Project will support investments in EE and PV systems in public buildings in participating countries that will contribute to substantial GHG emission reductions, both through reduced energy demand from public customers but also from increased RE generation currently heavily dependent on fossil fuels. Installations of DPV plus battery storage systems for critical public facilities, and upgrades on the grid for integration of RE, will also bring adaptation benefits increasing resilience of energy supply against extreme climate conditions, such as hurricanes, by reducing their reliance on grid supply."
