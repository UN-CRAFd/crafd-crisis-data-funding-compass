They may also provide additional background information, such as data on military holdings and procurement through national production. To date, 175 Member States have reported to the UNROCA instrument at least once. In light of relatively consistent reporting by the world’s largest arms exporters, it is estimated that the Register captures around 90 percent of the volume of the global arms trade.\n"

PRIMES is fully aligned with the [Policy on the Protection of Personal Data of Persons of Concern to UNHCR](http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=search&docid=55643c1d4).\n"

Covering topics such as protection, health, education, shelter, livelihoods, and food security, the survey offers critical data to inform evidence-based planning and prioritization, ensuring the specific needs of different refugee groups are addressed. Data collection was conducted through face-to-face interviews from May to July 2024 with a probability-based random sample of refugee households, managed collaboratively by UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration. Findings will guide strategic interventions and resource allocation to enhance the welfare and resilience of the refugee population in Estonia.\n"
