Through the UNROCA instrument, Member States are requested, on an annual basis, to report their international transfers of seven categories major conventional arms, as well as small arms and light weapons. They may also provide additional background information, such as data on military holdings and procurement through national production. To date, 175 Member States have reported to the UNROCA instrument at least once. In light of relatively consistent reporting by the world’s largest arms exporters, it is estimated that the Register captures around 90 percent of the volume of the global arms trade.\n",

Nevertheless, in the last decades, the field has seen the emergence of a new group of non-governmental actors that we have called Peace Facilitation Organizations (PFOs). PFOs are defined as follows: independent organizations which work consists in facilitating, advising, supporting or implementing peace mediation or dialogue initiatives. The PFOs mapping dataset maps the PFOs that currently operate worldwide, and provides information on their background, structure, approach, modus operandi, funding model and other characteristics. The mapping aims to provide some light to this field and give name to these organizations, mostly from Western countries, that have professionalised peace mediation and brought a certain degree of dexterity and standardisation to peace processes.\n",
