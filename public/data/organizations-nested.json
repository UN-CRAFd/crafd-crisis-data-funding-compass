We do so in the context of the Rohingya refugee camps, the largest refugee camps in the world, and a setting in which pervasive unemployment, strong gender norms, and high rates of domestic violence mark daily refugee experience. We hope the findings of this work may inform the design of social protection policies for the world’s forcibly displaced and long-term unemployed in the developing world.

            "The aim of the EDTech Hub programme is to “empower people by giving them the evidence they need to  make  decisions  about  technology  in  education  as  part  of  a  global  non-profit  partnership  focusing  on  research, innovation and engagement.”Specifically, this research study evaluates the impact of introducing education technology (edtech), such as school management apps and digital learning tools, to public schools in Pakistan. Previous work by Asim Khwaja and co-authors, funded through the Research on Improving Systems of Education (RISE), has shown that schools in Pakistan lack access to quality-enhancing education support services, including edtech. Yet, there is strong evidence that addressing the current learning crisis through technology-supported personalized learning can massively improve learning outcomes. This is particularly relevant when children have fallen even further behind on learning due to COVID-19 related school closures. This intervention tests how we can use technology to quickly and cheaply gather information about a student’s current learning levels, such as which concepts of third grade math they understand and which they struggle with, and provide parents and teachers with this information as well as suggestions on what to do to improve their child’s learning. This intervention will include student testing, communicating with teachers and parents through mobile phones, as well as student and parent surveys. This study builds on an ongoing Targeted Instruction intervention led by Dr. Tahir Andrabi in conjunction with federal and provincial Ministries of Education in Pakistan.

By integrating these drivers into one analytical stream, it delivers actionable insights tailored to conflict-affected and climate-vulnerable populations, filling critical gaps and enabling anticipatory action. Led by the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, together with the Netherlands Red Cross’ 510 Initiative and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the risk data supports more informed and anticipatory decision-making across the humanitarian system.

Many of the locations where these disasters occur are not represented on open and accessible maps, leaving first responders without the critical information needed to make informed decisions about relief efforts. Missing Maps is an open, collaborative project designed to map areas where humanitarian organizations are working to address the needs of people living at risk of disasters and crises. This initiative enables volunteers to contribute to mapping efforts, helping to ensure that vulnerable communities are visible and better supported during emergencies."

            "The support provided is flexible and demand driven. It also follows a human centered process, ensuring that client needs and the local context drive the definition of NLRC's support. The identified needs must be realistic in scope, must be within the ability of the NLRC to answer and finally, there must be a clear commitment from the recipient NS to engage proactively with NLRC throughout the project. The countries that will ultimately receive support through this project have not yet been determined but are expected to primarily be in the MENA (Middle East and Northern Africa) regions. Based on the knowledge collected and the changing dynamic of the pandemic, we anticipate that recipient national societies will request data and digital support in the following (generic) areas:\n1.\tContinuation of crucial data & digital support for NS for emergency support products\n2.\tSupport NS data and digital support for Covid vaccination campaign. \n3.\tCompounding disasters:  disaster response complicated by to the Covid pandemic\n4.\tCash IM support",
            "Through the 510 Data & Digital Team NLRC assists 19 RCRC National Societies in their short-term preparedness and response to COVID-19 and supported their operational continuity, through data and digital. This support was made possible through a 12-month block funded project that started implementation on 1 April 2020. At the time of writing (2 months before the end of the project) several countries are encountering a renewed increase of infections. New uncertainties are introduced by the virus mutations, underlining that the Covid response phase is far from over. With the approval of several vaccines and the start of vaccination campaigns in countries around the world, the focus is beginning to shift from response to recovery. The road however remains long and based on the achievements of the 2020 global COVID program and the feedback received the added value of continued data and digital support beyond the current project's end date, 31 March 2021, is clear.",

Currently, several developments have resulted in early field testing and deployment. The Netherlands Red Cross (NLRC), Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) and the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), all partners within S(P)EEDKITS, have on-going field operations. Selected solutions can be tested in these humanitarian operations, usually in situations where infrastructure is poor and skilled labour scarce.",

The selected kits are shelter units, wash solutions (sanitation-, water -, and add-on kits), and infrastructural solutions. The aim is to demonstrate transportability and rapid deployment of the kits in an operational field context.",

Through the UNROCA instrument, Member States are requested, on an annual basis, to report their international transfers of seven categories of major conventional arms, as well as small arms and light weapons. They may also provide additional background information, such as data on military holdings and procurement through national production. To date, 175 Member States have reported to the UNROCA instrument at least once. In light of relatively consistent reporting by the world’s largest arms exporters, it is estimated that the Register captures around 90 percent of the volume of the global arms trade."

These include gaps in digital infrastructure, an evolving policy environment, limited investments in systemic reforms, and the need for stronger institutional capacity to integrate advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digital platforms. Addressing these constraints is essential to accelerating inclusive growth, enhancing global competitiveness, and positioning Turkmenistan as a regional leader in the digital economy. Gender-specific challenges and leveraging opportunities for women and marginalized groups is critical to ensuring an inclusive and equitable digital transformation."

It is recognized as the leading forum for international economic cooperation with a focus on shaping and strengthening global architecture and governance on all major international economic issues. Composed of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union, the group will have Brazil as the hostess country in 2024 (from December 1, 2023 to November 30, 2024). One of the characteristics of the G20 is the existence of the so-called Sherpa and Finance tracks, with thematic sub-groups that meet regularly throughout the year, in dozens of face-to-face meetings in the country hosting the presidency.In particular, the Finance track is made up of the finance ministers or their equivalent and the presidents of the central banks of the member countries. These representatives discuss global economic and financial issues, such as fiscal policies, international trade, financial stability, and international financial architecture. Considering the urgency of time - the presidency begins in December 2023 - and the need to carry out short-term preparatory activities until the project is signed, it is considered opportune for UNDP to provide support in this preparatory phase."

            "The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) opened its branch in Côte d'Ivoire in 2011 in response to the post-election crisis. This crisis, which shook the country between November 2010 and May 2011, affected more than two million people, causing the displacement of more than 600,000 people inside the country and more than 180,000 new Ivorian refugees to countries of the sub-region. Since 2011, the situation in Côte d'Ivoire has improved significantly in political, security and socio-economic terms. Most internally displaced persons (IDPs) have returned to their villages of origin and humanitarian actors continue to support the gradual and voluntary return and sustainable reintegration of refugees and IDPs. OCHA's expertise continues to be sought in the context of emergency preparedness, to develop inter-agency contingency plans in the face of the various climate risks that threaten the country. The transition from emergency to development, which began in 2013, first resulted in the transfer of responsibility for strategic humanitarian coordination to the government, through the establishment of the Extended Coordination Committee (CCE) which brings together government officials with humanitarian actors and development partners. In support of government efforts, OCHA supports and coordinates the development of preparedness and response plans (disaster risk reduction, Ebola, evictions from classified forests, etc.) and facilitates training related to emergency preparedness. OCHA is also very active in establishing an innovative and sustainable partnership between the authorities, humanitarian actors and the private sector in Côte d'Ivoire.",
            "Le Bureau de la coordination des affaires humanitaires (OCHA) des Nations Unies a ouvert son antenne en Côte d’Ivoire en 2011 en réponse à la crise post-électorale. Cette crise, qui a secoué le pays entre novembre 2010 et mai 2011, a affecté plus de deux millions de personnes, provoquant le déplacement de plus de 600 000 personnes à l’intérieur du pays et de plus de 180 000 nouveaux réfugiés ivoiriens vers les pays de la sous-région. Depuis 2011, la situation de la Côte d’Ivoire s’est nettement améliorée sur les plans politique, sécuritaire et socio-économique. La plupart des personnes déplacées internes (PDI) sont retournées dans leurs villages d’origine et les acteurs humanitaires continuent de soutenir le retour progressif et volontaire et la réintégration durable des réfugiés et des PDI. L'expertise d'OCHA continue d’être sollicitée dans le cadre de la préparation à l'urgence, pour développer les plans de contingence inter-agences face aux différents risques climatiques qui menacent le pays. La transition de l’urgence au développement, amorcée en 2013, s’est d’abord traduite par la passation de la responsabilité de la coordination humanitaire stratégique au gouvernement, à travers la mise en place du Comité de Coordination Elargi (CCE) qui réunit les représentants du gouvernement avec les acteurs humanitaires et les partenaires au développement.En soutien aux efforts du gouvernement, OCHA appui et coordonne le développement des plans de préparation et de réponse (réduction des risques des catastrophes, Ebola, déguerpissements des forêts classées, etc.) et facilite des formations liées à la préparation à l'urgence. OCHA est en outre très actif pour établir un partenariat innovant et durable entre les autorités, les acteurs humanitaires et le secteur privé en Côte d’Ivoire."

OCHA’s presence was scaled back in the ensuing years, but the organization re-established an office in 2009 to assist over 3 million people displaced by insecurity in the north-west. OCHA provides comprehensive support to the humanitarian community in activities related to coordinating emergency preparedness planning, humanitarian response, disaster risk reductionand resilience.

            "The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Country Office in Eritrea was established in 2000 following the 1998-2000 border conflict with Ethiopia. Since that date, programmes and projects of an urgent or humanitarian nature have been built into the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) and, since 2013, the joint UN-GoSE Strategic Partnership Cooperation Framework (SPCF). OCHA has been coordinating humanitarian response on an annual basis, which constitutes part of the five-year development cooperation framework. Working closely with the UN Country Team (UNCT) in Eritrea, the OCHA Country Office coordinates humanitarian analysis, prioritization and response through the projects of UN agencies which work closely with their Government implementing partners, and in the absence of INGOs. OCHA’s presence in Eritrea ensures that urgent and humanitarian issues are integrated into wider development processes. In coordination with the UNCT and the RCO, OCHA also facilitates the UNCT’s preparedness and contingency planning processes. Furthermore, OCHA expertise in information management ensures production of regular resource mobilization data, snapshots and analysis on behalf of the UNCT, as well as assisting UN agencies and partners with visualization, GIS and mapping services. OCHA Eritrea supports the resource mobilization efforts of the UNCT, with particular focus on urgent response and basic services. This is done through OCHA’s own engagements with donors, as well as support to the Resident Coordinator /Humanitarian Coordinator and UNCT in their resource mobilization efforts. OCHA maintains close and regular contacts with both resident and non-resident embassies and donor partners, providing regular updates and briefings. OCHA also coordinates CERF applications and processes in support of allocations for Eritrea.",

            "The humanitarian situation in Venezuela was the result of seven consecutive years of economic contraction, periods of hyperinflation, political polarization and institutional challenges. The pandemic deepened the needs of people due to the impact on essential services such as health care, water, gas and electricity. The food insecurity situation was also aggravated. The office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance coordinated assistance to people across the country, mostly to provide health, water, sanitation, hygiene, protection and education services.  Office for the Coordination on Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) played a leading role in integrating cross-cutting issues in the response, such as gender and protection, and in strengthening accountability to affected people (AAP) and protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA). The HCT adopted the Collective AAP Framework and the protocol that defines procedures for submitting PSEA complaint.",

            "Despite 2016 the Peace Agreement between the Government and the FARC-EP ending decades of civil war and progress in improving economic and social conditions, Colombia continues to face numerous humanitarian challenges. In some regions of the country, hostilities and armed violence continue, with significant humanitarian impact and protection challenges. This situation is further exacerbated by the impact of natural disasters, presence of landmines and unexploded ordnance and, now, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The latter has led to an increase in the number of food-insecure people from 3.3 million to over 10 million. So far in 2020, the humanitarian community in Colombia has provided assistance – including COVID-19 related assistance – to almost a million people. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) currently supports a humanitarian coordination architecture consisting of around 120 partners, including UN agencies, national and international NGOs, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, civil society, donors and national institutions.",
            "A pesar de que en 2016 el Acuerdo de Paz entre el Gobierno y las FARC-EP puso fin a décadas de guerra civil y de los avances en la mejora de las condiciones económicas y sociales, Colombia sigue enfrentándose a numerosos retos humanitarios. En algunas regiones del país, las hostilidades y la violencia armada continúan, con un impacto humanitario significativo y con desafíos de protección. Esta situación se ve agravada por el impacto de los desastres de origen natural, la presencia de minas terrestres y municiones sin explotar y, ahora, el impacto de la pandemia COVID-19. Esta última ha provocado un aumento del número de personas en situación de inseguridad alimentaria de 3,3 millones a más de 10 millones. En lo que va de 2020, la comunidad humanitaria de Colombia ha prestado asistencia -incluida la relacionada con la COVID-19- a casi un millón de personas. La Oficina de Coordinación de Asuntos Humanitarios (OCHA) apoya actualmente una arquitectura de coordinación humanitaria formada por unos 120 socios, entre los que se encuentran organismos de la ONU, ONG nacionales e internacionales, el Movimiento de la Cruz Roja y la Media Luna Roja, la sociedad civil, donantes e instituciones nacionales."

            "Cameroon is affected by three simultaneous protection crises that are exacerbating the humanitarian situation of affected people. Increased violence in the Lake Chad Basin and in the North-West and South-West regions continues to cause internal displacement. Moreover, hundreds of refugees from the Central African Republic (CAR) have found shelter in the eastern regions of Cameroon and rely on life-saving and life-sustaining humanitarian assistance. Since 2015, humanitarian organizations have been jointly working with the Government to scale up the response in Cameroon.  Office for the Coordination on Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) supports more than 170 humanitarian organizations that are providing emergency assistance to crisis-affected people. The main focus of the humanitarian response operation will continue to be providing life-saving assistance and protection to affected populations, promoting long-term voluntary and safe durable solutions when relevant and feasible, and strengthening early recovery and community resilience.",

            "Even before the pandemic began, 2020 was on track to be the most difficult year of the past decade for Burkina Faso. A succession of shocks linked to conflict and insecurity had driven more than 1 million people from their homes since early 2019.  And for the first time in 10 years, the country saw the re-emergence of critical food insecurity conditions in two provinces of the Sahel region.  Office for the Coordination on Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) gradually increased its capacity to support collective priorities for humanitarian coordination at the national and regional levels, securing dedicated capacity to provide leadership on humanitarian civil-military coordination, community engagement, Accountability to Affected People, Information Management and analysis, and protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA).",

Une succession de chocs liés au conflit et à l'insécurité avait poussé plus d'un million de personnes à quitter leur foyer depuis le début de 2019. Et pour la première fois en 10 ans, le pays a vu réapparaître des conditions d'insécurité alimentaire critiques dans deux provinces de la région du Sahel. Le Bureau de la Coordination des Affaires Humanitaires (OCHA) a progressivement augmenté sa capacité à soutenir les priorités collectives en matière de coordination humanitaire aux niveaux national et régional, en obtenant des capacités dédiées pour assurer le leadership en matière de coordination humanitaire civilo-militaire, d'engagement communautaire, de responsabilité envers les personnes affectées, de gestion et d'analyse de l'information, et de protection contre l'exploitation et les abus sexuels (PEAS)."

            "Central African Republic continues to face a serious protection crisis, with a steady increase in violations of human rights and international humanitarian law despite the signing of the Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in 2019. Those who suffer the most, they are the civilian populations. One in four Central Africans is displaced either within the country or to a neighboring country, and the waves of return of displaced and repatriated people have slowed considerably. Since last year, the number of people in need has increased from 2.6 million to 2.8 million (+8%). At the same time, the number of people in need of acute assistance is 12% higher than in 2020. In five years, CAR has never counted so many people in humanitarian distress. This increase is the direct consequence of the plunge in macroeconomic indicators, the advent of new pockets of violent conflict, the rise of food insecurity and the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "La RCA continue à faire face à une grave crise de protection, avec une augmentation constante des violations des droits humains et du droit international humanitaire malgré la signature de l'Accord Politique pour la Paix et la Réconciliation en 2019. Ceux qui souffrent le plus, ce sont les populations civiles. Un Centrafricain sur quatre est déplacé soit à l'intérieur du pays ou dans un pays voisin, et les vagues de retour de personnes déplacées et rapatriées ont considérablement ralenti. Depuis l’année dernière, le nombre de personnes dans le besoin a augmenté, passant de 2,6 millions à 2,8 millions (+8%). En même temps, le nombre de personnes en besoin d’assistance aiguë est de 12% supérieur qu’en 2020. En cinq ans, jamais la RCA n’avait compté autant de personnes en situation de détresse humanitaire. Cette augmentation est la conséquence directe de la plongée des indicateurs macro-économiques, l’avènement de nouvelles poches de conflits violents, la montée de l’insécurité alimentaire et la pandémie de la COVID-19."

            "The OCHA Regional Office for Middle East and North Africa (ROMENA) based in Cairo and Amman and covers 21 countries and territories spread across the region. Several countries in the Middle East and North Africa region are experiencing political, economic and social transformations which have resulted in humanitarian crises causing an increase in human suffering and vulnerability. The situation is further compounded by hazards and natural disasters such as earthquakes, drought and floods. In this regard, OCHA ROMENA works to support and strengthen humanitarian coordination and response preparedness in the region. In countries where OCHA maintains country office presence including Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Syria, Turkey, Yemen and occupied Palestinian Territory, the regional office provides frontline surge capacity as required particularly to support escalating or sudden on-set emergencies. For countries without OCHA in-country presence, the ROMENA team aims to support national authorities, regional bodies, Resident Coordinators and UN Country Teams to strengthen emergency preparedness and response to effectively and efficiently respond to or prepare for emergency situations through physical deployment or remote support.",

The different needs produced by these long-standing conditions have formed a complex fabric of vulnerabilities that humanitarian action has sought to address with intersectoral approaches for several years. Despite achievements in providing holistic responses to multidimensional needs in the NCA, humanitarian action in these countries was forced to drastically reconfigure in 2020 in the face of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and seasonal most active hurricane ever recorded.",

            "Jordan is a key strategic partner for the UN and the international community. An island of stability in a troubled region, it has been a generous host to refugees throughout its history. Since the onset of the Syrian crisis in 2011, over one million Syrians have fled into Jordan, of which 662,000 are registered refugees.  Office for the Coordination on Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) regional support to the Syria crisis continued to provide support in policy, planning, operational coordination and administrative services to humanitarian organizations across the response. It brings together humanitarian organizations working from within and outside Syria to develop a shared analysis, common objectives and a collective focus on results. The regional support focuses on enhancing its engagement and coordination with key regional stakeholders in the response, namely UN Regional Directors, international NGOs, Member States and donors.",

            "The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) was established in September 2004 in Chad by the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) to provide a large-scale humanitarian response to nearly 200,000 people from Sudan neighbor (Darfur) between 2003 and 2004. The OCHA team in Chad works closely with the entire humanitarian community, which includes government entities at the national and provincial levels, 11 UN agencies, 48 ??international NGOs and 67 national NGOs. On the strength of the excellent collaboration resulting from these partnerships, OCHA plays an important role in coordinating the response to the various crises by setting up, whenever necessary, While working to ensure the maintenance of humanitarian space, OCHA is also working to strengthen the capacities of partners and to achieve greater coherence between humanitarian, development and peacebuilding activities through effective collaboration with all actors and by seeking the involvement of all, from the planning stage to the identification of priorities for humanitarian action in Chad. This active and inclusive partnership makes it possible to address, in a coordinated manner, the humanitarian consequences caused by the recurrent crises linked in particular to food insecurity and malnutrition, population movements, health emergencies, and the negative effects of climate change (floods and drought) and at the same time strengthen the resilience of populations.",
            "Le Bureau de la Coordination des Affaires Humanitaires (OCHA) a été établi en septembre 2004 au Tchad par le Coordonnateur des Secours d'Urgence des Nations Unies (ERC) pour apporter une réponse humanitaire d’envergure à près de 200 000 personnes venues du Soudan voisin (Darfour) entre 2003 et 2004. L'équipe OCHA au Tchad travaille en étroite collaboration avec l'ensemble de la communauté humanitaire, qui comprend des entités gouvernementales aux niveaux national et provincial, 11 agences des Nations Unies, 48 ONG internationales et 67 ONG nationales. Fort d’une excellente collaboration issue de ces partenariats, OCHA joue un rôle important dans la coordination de la réponse aux différentes crises en mettant en place, chaque fois que nécessaire, des mécanismes de coordination de l’assistance humanitaire internationale adaptés au contexte et en appui au gouvernement pour apporter secours et assistance aux populations locales affectées. Tout en œuvrant pour assurer le maintien de l’espace humanitaire, OCHA travaille par ailleurs au renforcement des capacités des partenaires et à une plus grande cohérence entre les activités humanitaires, de développement et de consolidation de la paix à travers une collaboration efficace avec tous les acteurs et en recherchant l’implication de tous, depuis le stade de la planification à l’indentification des priorités de l’action humanitaire au Tchad. Ce partenariat actif et inclusif permet d’adresser de façon coordonnée, les conséquences humanitaires engendrées par les crises récurrentes liées notamment à l'insécurité alimentaire et à la malnutrition, aux mouvements de populations, aux urgences sanitaires, et aux effets négatifs du changement climatique (inondations et sécheresse) et de renforcer concomitamment la résilience des populations."

            "The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has been present in Niger since 2005, a year particularly marked by a serious food crisis. Since then, OCHA Niger, in support of the Humanitarian Coordinator and the Government, coordinates emergency assistance to populations affected by multiple crises. OCHA Niger works in close collaboration with all State structures both in the field and in Niamey, highlighting, whenever possible, the leadership of national structures, while ensuring respect for humanitarian and operational principles. Niger faces a complex humanitarian emergency marked by continued insecurity and violence against civilians perpetrated by elements of armed groups, endemic poverty, the effects of climate change, including seasonal flooding and pockets of drought. The humanitarian situation is further aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic which is leading to an exponential increase in needs.",

CDRs are datasets automatically generated by mobile operators for billing purposes, regardless of phone type, and represent an attractive data source for estimating internal migration and displacement, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where data on human mobility are often scarce. These methods enable a more comprehensive understanding of population dynamics, supporting evidence-based decision making in critical sectors."

Using these data, Flowminder has developed a new methodology to support decision makers in identifying optimal locations for their services and to facilitate data-driven decision making."

Implemented by IMPACT Initiatives through its REACH Initiative, the MSNA collects statistically representative, household-level data on sectors such as food security, health, shelter, WASH, education, and protection. While the initiative is closely coordinated with OCHA and humanitarian clusters in country-led responses, the technical design, survey implementation, and analysis are primarily led by REACH/IMPACT, with operational support from agencies like IOM , WFP or IMMAP."

            "The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) opened its branch in Côte d'Ivoire in 2011 in response to the post-election crisis. This crisis, which shook the country between November 2010 and May 2011, affected more than two million people, causing the displacement of more than 600,000 people inside the country and more than 180,000 new Ivorian refugees to countries of the sub-region. Since 2011, the situation in Côte d'Ivoire has improved significantly in political, security and socio-economic terms. Most internally displaced persons (IDPs) have returned to their villages of origin and humanitarian actors continue to support the gradual and voluntary return and sustainable reintegration of refugees and IDPs. OCHA's expertise continues to be sought in the context of emergency preparedness, to develop inter-agency contingency plans in the face of the various climate risks that threaten the country. The transition from emergency to development, which began in 2013, first resulted in the transfer of responsibility for strategic humanitarian coordination to the government, through the establishment of the Extended Coordination Committee (CCE) which brings together government officials with humanitarian actors and development partners. In support of government efforts, OCHA supports and coordinates the development of preparedness and response plans (disaster risk reduction, Ebola, evictions from classified forests, etc.) and facilitates training related to emergency preparedness. OCHA is also very active in establishing an innovative and sustainable partnership between the authorities, humanitarian actors and the private sector in Côte d'Ivoire.",
            "Le Bureau de la coordination des affaires humanitaires (OCHA) des Nations Unies a ouvert son antenne en Côte d’Ivoire en 2011 en réponse à la crise post-électorale. Cette crise, qui a secoué le pays entre novembre 2010 et mai 2011, a affecté plus de deux millions de personnes, provoquant le déplacement de plus de 600 000 personnes à l’intérieur du pays et de plus de 180 000 nouveaux réfugiés ivoiriens vers les pays de la sous-région. Depuis 2011, la situation de la Côte d’Ivoire s’est nettement améliorée sur les plans politique, sécuritaire et socio-économique. La plupart des personnes déplacées internes (PDI) sont retournées dans leurs villages d’origine et les acteurs humanitaires continuent de soutenir le retour progressif et volontaire et la réintégration durable des réfugiés et des PDI. L'expertise d'OCHA continue d’être sollicitée dans le cadre de la préparation à l'urgence, pour développer les plans de contingence inter-agences face aux différents risques climatiques qui menacent le pays. La transition de l’urgence au développement, amorcée en 2013, s’est d’abord traduite par la passation de la responsabilité de la coordination humanitaire stratégique au gouvernement, à travers la mise en place du Comité de Coordination Elargi (CCE) qui réunit les représentants du gouvernement avec les acteurs humanitaires et les partenaires au développement.En soutien aux efforts du gouvernement, OCHA appui et coordonne le développement des plans de préparation et de réponse (réduction des risques des catastrophes, Ebola, déguerpissements des forêts classées, etc.) et facilite des formations liées à la préparation à l'urgence. OCHA est en outre très actif pour établir un partenariat innovant et durable entre les autorités, les acteurs humanitaires et le secteur privé en Côte d’Ivoire."

            "Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) involvement in Pakistan began in 1987, when an office was set up in Peshawar to support the organization’s Afghanistan operations.

OCHA has been coordinating humanitarian response on an annual basis, which constitutes part of the five-year development cooperation framework. Working closely with the UN Country Team (UNCT) in Eritrea, the OCHA Country Office coordinates humanitarian analysis, prioritization and response through the projects of UN agencies which work closely with their Government implementing partners, and in the absence of INGOs. OCHA’s presence in Eritrea ensures that urgent and humanitarian issues are integrated into wider development processes. In coordination with the UNCT and the RCO, OCHA also facilitates the UNCT’s preparedness and contingency planning processes. Furthermore, OCHA expertise in information management ensures production of regular resource mobilization data, snapshots and analysis on behalf of the UNCT, as well as assisting UN agencies and partners with visualization, GIS and mapping services. OCHA Eritrea supports the resource mobilization efforts of the UNCT, with particular focus on urgent response and basic services. This is done through OCHA’s own engagements with donors, as well as support to the Resident Coordinator /Humanitarian Coordinator and UNCT in their resource mobilization efforts.

The office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance coordinated assistance to people across the country, mostly to provide health, water, sanitation, hygiene, protection and education services.  Office for the Coordination on Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) played a leading role in integrating cross-cutting issues in the response, such as gender and protection, and in strengthening accountability to affected people (AAP) and protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA).

            "Despite 2016 the Peace Agreement between the Government and the FARC-EP ending decades of civil war and progress in improving economic and social conditions, Colombia continues to face numerous humanitarian challenges. In some regions of the country, hostilities and armed violence continue, with significant humanitarian impact and protection challenges. This situation is further exacerbated by the impact of natural disasters, presence of landmines and unexploded ordnance and, now, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The latter has led to an increase in the number of food-insecure people from 3.3 million to over 10 million. So far in 2020, the humanitarian community in Colombia has provided assistance – including COVID-19 related assistance – to almost a million people. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) currently supports a humanitarian coordination architecture consisting of around 120 partners, including UN agencies, national and international NGOs, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, civil society, donors and national institutions.",
            "A pesar de que en 2016 el Acuerdo de Paz entre el Gobierno y las FARC-EP puso fin a décadas de guerra civil y de los avances en la mejora de las condiciones económicas y sociales, Colombia sigue enfrentándose a numerosos retos humanitarios. En algunas regiones del país, las hostilidades y la violencia armada continúan, con un impacto humanitario significativo y con desafíos de protección. Esta situación se ve agravada por el impacto de los desastres de origen natural, la presencia de minas terrestres y municiones sin explotar y, ahora, el impacto de la pandemia COVID-19. Esta última ha provocado un aumento del número de personas en situación de inseguridad alimentaria de 3,3 millones a más de 10 millones. En lo que va de 2020, la comunidad humanitaria de Colombia ha prestado asistencia -incluida la relacionada con la COVID-19- a casi un millón de personas. La Oficina de Coordinación de Asuntos Humanitarios (OCHA) apoya actualmente una arquitectura de coordinación humanitaria formada por unos 120 socios, entre los que se encuentran organismos de la ONU, ONG nacionales e internacionales, el Movimiento de la Cruz Roja y la Media Luna Roja, la sociedad civil, donantes e instituciones nacionales."

Since 2015, humanitarian organizations have been jointly working with the Government to scale up the response in Cameroon.  Office for the Coordination on Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) supports more than 170 humanitarian organizations that are providing emergency assistance to crisis-affected people. The main focus of the humanitarian response operation will continue to be providing life-saving assistance and protection to affected populations, promoting long-term voluntary and safe durable solutions when relevant and feasible, and strengthening early recovery and community resilience.",

            "Even before the pandemic began, 2020 was on track to be the most difficult year of the past decade for Burkina Faso. A succession of shocks linked to conflict and insecurity had driven more than 1 million people from their homes since early 2019.  And for the first time in 10 years, the country saw the re-emergence of critical food insecurity conditions in two provinces of the Sahel region.  Office for the Coordination on Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) gradually increased its capacity to support collective priorities for humanitarian coordination at the national and regional levels, securing dedicated capacity to provide leadership on humanitarian civil-military coordination, community engagement, Accountability to Affected People, Information Management and analysis, and protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA).",

Une succession de chocs liés au conflit et à l'insécurité avait poussé plus d'un million de personnes à quitter leur foyer depuis le début de 2019. Et pour la première fois en 10 ans, le pays a vu réapparaître des conditions d'insécurité alimentaire critiques dans deux provinces de la région du Sahel. Le Bureau de la Coordination des Affaires Humanitaires (OCHA) a progressivement augmenté sa capacité à soutenir les priorités collectives en matière de coordination humanitaire aux niveaux national et régional, en obtenant des capacités dédiées pour assurer le leadership en matière de coordination humanitaire civilo-militaire, d'engagement communautaire, de responsabilité envers les personnes affectées, de gestion et d'analyse de l'information, et de protection contre l'exploitation et les abus sexuels (PEAS)."

            "Central African Republic continues to face a serious protection crisis, with a steady increase in violations of human rights and international humanitarian law despite the signing of the Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in 2019. Those who suffer the most, they are the civilian populations. One in four Central Africans is displaced either within the country or to a neighboring country, and the waves of return of displaced and repatriated people have slowed considerably. Since last year, the number of people in need has increased from 2.6 million to 2.8 million (+8%). At the same time, the number of people in need of acute assistance is 12% higher than in 2020. In five years, CAR has never counted so many people in humanitarian distress. This increase is the direct consequence of the plunge in macroeconomic indicators, the advent of new pockets of violent conflict, the rise of food insecurity and the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "La RCA continue à faire face à une grave crise de protection, avec une augmentation constante des violations des droits humains et du droit international humanitaire malgré la signature de l'Accord Politique pour la Paix et la Réconciliation en 2019. Ceux qui souffrent le plus, ce sont les populations civiles. Un Centrafricain sur quatre est déplacé soit à l'intérieur du pays ou dans un pays voisin, et les vagues de retour de personnes déplacées et rapatriées ont considérablement ralenti. Depuis l’année dernière, le nombre de personnes dans le besoin a augmenté, passant de 2,6 millions à 2,8 millions (+8%). En même temps, le nombre de personnes en besoin d’assistance aiguë est de 12% supérieur qu’en 2020. En cinq ans, jamais la RCA n’avait compté autant de personnes en situation de détresse humanitaire. Cette augmentation est la conséquence directe de la plongée des indicateurs macro-économiques, l’avènement de nouvelles poches de conflits violents, la montée de l’insécurité alimentaire et la pandémie de la COVID-19."

            "The OCHA Regional Office for Middle East and North Africa (ROMENA) based in Cairo and Amman and covers 21 countries and territories spread across the region. Several countries in the Middle East and North Africa region are experiencing political, economic and social transformations which have resulted in humanitarian crises causing an increase in human suffering and vulnerability. The situation is further compounded by hazards and natural disasters such as earthquakes, drought and floods. In this regard, OCHA ROMENA works to support and strengthen humanitarian coordination and response preparedness in the region. In countries where OCHA maintains country office presence including Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Syria, Turkey, Yemen and occupied Palestinian Territory, the regional office provides frontline surge capacity as required particularly to support escalating or sudden on-set emergencies. For countries without OCHA in-country presence, the ROMENA team aims to support national authorities, regional bodies, Resident Coordinators and UN Country Teams to strengthen emergency preparedness and response to effectively and efficiently respond to or prepare for emergency situations through physical deployment or remote support.",

The different needs produced by these long-standing conditions have formed a complex fabric of vulnerabilities that humanitarian action has sought to address with intersectoral approaches for several years. Despite achievements in providing holistic responses to multidimensional needs in the NCA, humanitarian action in these countries was forced to drastically reconfigure in 2020 in the face of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and seasonal most active hurricane ever recorded.",

            "Jordan is a key strategic partner for the UN and the international community. An island of stability in a troubled region, it has been a generous host to refugees throughout its history. Since the onset of the Syrian crisis in 2011, over one million Syrians have fled into Jordan, of which 662,000 are registered refugees.  Office for the Coordination on Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) regional support to the Syria crisis continued to provide support in policy, planning, operational coordination and administrative services to humanitarian organizations across the response. It brings together humanitarian organizations working from within and outside Syria to develop a shared analysis, common objectives and a collective focus on results. The regional support focuses on enhancing its engagement and coordination with key regional stakeholders in the response, namely UN Regional Directors, international NGOs, Member States and donors.",

            "The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) was established in September 2004 in Chad by the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) to provide a large-scale humanitarian response to nearly 200,000 people from Sudan neighbor (Darfur) between 2003 and 2004. The OCHA team in Chad works closely with the entire humanitarian community, which includes government entities at the national and provincial levels, 11 UN agencies, 48 ??international NGOs and 67 national NGOs. On the strength of the excellent collaboration resulting from these partnerships, OCHA plays an important role in coordinating the response to the various crises by setting up, whenever necessary, While working to ensure the maintenance of humanitarian space, OCHA is also working to strengthen the capacities of partners and to achieve greater coherence between humanitarian, development and peacebuilding activities through effective collaboration with all actors and by seeking the involvement of all, from the planning stage to the identification of priorities for humanitarian action in Chad. This active and inclusive partnership makes it possible to address, in a coordinated manner, the humanitarian consequences caused by the recurrent crises linked in particular to food insecurity and malnutrition, population movements, health emergencies, and the negative effects of climate change (floods and drought) and at the same time strengthen the resilience of populations.",
            "Le Bureau de la Coordination des Affaires Humanitaires (OCHA) a été établi en septembre 2004 au Tchad par le Coordonnateur des Secours d'Urgence des Nations Unies (ERC) pour apporter une réponse humanitaire d’envergure à près de 200 000 personnes venues du Soudan voisin (Darfour) entre 2003 et 2004. L'équipe OCHA au Tchad travaille en étroite collaboration avec l'ensemble de la communauté humanitaire, qui comprend des entités gouvernementales aux niveaux national et provincial, 11 agences des Nations Unies, 48 ONG internationales et 67 ONG nationales. Fort d’une excellente collaboration issue de ces partenariats, OCHA joue un rôle important dans la coordination de la réponse aux différentes crises en mettant en place, chaque fois que nécessaire, des mécanismes de coordination de l’assistance humanitaire internationale adaptés au contexte et en appui au gouvernement pour apporter secours et assistance aux populations locales affectées. Tout en œuvrant pour assurer le maintien de l’espace humanitaire, OCHA travaille par ailleurs au renforcement des capacités des partenaires et à une plus grande cohérence entre les activités humanitaires, de développement et de consolidation de la paix à travers une collaboration efficace avec tous les acteurs et en recherchant l’implication de tous, depuis le stade de la planification à l’indentification des priorités de l’action humanitaire au Tchad. Ce partenariat actif et inclusif permet d’adresser de façon coordonnée, les conséquences humanitaires engendrées par les crises récurrentes liées notamment à l'insécurité alimentaire et à la malnutrition, aux mouvements de populations, aux urgences sanitaires, et aux effets négatifs du changement climatique (inondations et sécheresse) et de renforcer concomitamment la résilience des populations."

In recent decades, however, the field has witnessed the emergence of a new group of non-governmental actors known as Peace Facilitation Organizations (PFOs). PFOs are defined as independent organizations whose work consists of facilitating, advising, supporting, or implementing peace mediation or dialogue initiatives. The PFOs mapping dataset documents the PFOs that currently operate worldwide and provides information on their background, structure, approach, modus operandi, funding model, and other characteristics. The mapping aims to shed light on this field and identify these organizations, primarily from Western countries, that have professionalized peace mediation and contributed a certain degree of dexterity and standardization to peace processes."

This resulted in the first Whole of Afghanistan Assessment (WoAA). The WoAA was designed to increase humanitarian organisations’ understanding of the multi-sector needs and vulnerabilities of different population groups across Afghanistan by providing multi-sector baseline information for the 2019 Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) and for any subsequent adjustments in programming required to the current Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) (2018-2021). This assessment took substantial steps to ‘Improve Joint and Impartial Needs Assessments’, as outlined in the Grand Bargain Agenda, by strengthening last year’s evidence-base used by the humanitarian community, which previously depended upon heavily localised and not statistically sound data, resulting in the limited capacity of findings to determine priorities and guide planning"

However, almost 1 million people are believed to reside in inaccessible areas outside these towns, where persistent insecurity makes consistent humanitarian access challenging (HRP 2018). \r\nYears of conflict have disrupted agricultural activity, market functionality, and supply routes, leading to dire nutrition and food security conditions - an estimated 3.7 million and 3.5 million people to be in need of food and supplementary nutrition assistance, respectively. Borno State faces a particularly challenging food security situation, where 36% of the population are projected to face crisis or emergency phases of food and nutrition security from June-August 2018 (Cadre Harmonise, October 2017).\r\nDisplaced, non-displaced and returnee populations also face a deeply difficult protection situation, with the 2018 HRP estimating 5.8 million people in need of assistance. Protection concerns are wide-ranging, including conflict-related violence, gender-based violence, family separation, forced marriage, child marriage, forced displacement, arbitrary detention, seizure of belongings, and abduction. The protection threats facing populations are likely to be most acute in inaccessible rural areas with significant Armed Opposition Group (AOG) presence. A February 2018 REACH assessment focussing on recent displacement into the town of Pulka (Gwoza LGA, Borno State) found that, prior to escaping, civilians had been forcibly held captive in their villages for months by AOGs, who threatened them with beatings or execution if they tried to escape and frequently seized their harvests."

REACH proposes a multi-pronged approach to fill information management gaps and enhance the response and prioritisation of humanitarian and government actors in all three drought affected countries. In Kenya REACH will conduct an assessment in Turkana and Marsabit counties, which are hard-hit by the drought and considered to be candidates to potentially deteriorate into IPC Phase 4 levels of food insecurity. REACH will provide a multi-sectoral lens to the National Drought Management Authority’s (NDMA) food security findings, to encourage implementing actors to take an integrated approach to humanitarian activities to minimise the risk of excess mortality. Under the proposed project’s second objective, REACH will strengthen the analysis and remote sensing capacity of its existing activities, to provide granular data culminating in an analysis output that highlights most vulnerable populations across all three countries."

To fill these identified information management gaps, REACH has been collaborating closely and feeding information into the humanitarian architecture in South Sudan to support in tracking of humanitarian needs. Primarily this has been conducted through its AoK remote monitoring (please see Section 4.5) and subsequent information sharing and collaboration with the clusters, the Inter-Cluster Working Group (ICWG) and the Integrated Phase Classification Technical Working Group (IPC TWG). To support improvements in the emergency response prioritization process, in early 2018, REACH played a central role in pushing for shifts in the humanitarian architecture to improve real-time analysis and evidence-based decision making through the set up and co-chairing of the Needs Analysis Working Group (NAWG), tasked with supporting ICWG in emergency response prioritization, and the development of the Integrated Needs Tracking System (INT), tasked by the FSL, WASH, Health and Nutrition clusters to develop an integrated needs monitoring system to support the clusters in prioritizing emergency areas for famine prevention responses."

The IPC from October 2018 estimated 59% of South Sudan’s population to face crisis, emergency and catastrophic food insecurity, which makes evidence-based targeting of existing funds a critical necessity to save lives potentially at risk. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, the dynamic and multi-faceted nature of the South Sudan crisis has created significant challenges for humanitarian information management. Accessibility and security issues within South Sudan have impeded systematic direct data collection efforts – limiting the ability to monitor needs and therefore provide timely information for effective targeting inside the country. As a result, it is becoming increasingly important to adopt adaptive and innovative approaches to filling information gaps in a systematic manner to promote more effective humanitarian response and planning."

            "As of July 2022, Sri Lanka is facing an economic crisis rooted in high inflation, fuel shortages and low foreign exchange reserves. The UN Humanitarian Needs and Priorities (HNP) Plan (launched 09 June) estimated 5.7 people in need.   \r\nWhile many, including WFP and FAO , expect a deterioration of the situation, there is still an absence of critical sources of information on community priorities in terms of humanitarian assistance as well as perceptions of ongoing programming among affected people. Moreover, humanitarian decision makers are faced with a critical gap of information on the differential impact of the crisis on various groups of people, especially in terms of how the compounding multi-dimensional crisis is exacerbating pre-existing vulnerabilities through a loss of access to resources and reduction in access to essential services among persons with disabilities, older people, female-headed households, persons with critical illnesses and others.\r\nTo support response actors to prioritize and plan with enhanced awareness of community preferences in terms of humanitarian assistance and modalities of assistance, REACH  proposes to launch a participatory assessment focused on Accountability to Affected People. The assessment will seek community triangulation of the assumptions that underly the current humanitarian response in terms of what the drivers of the crisis are, how the crisis is impacting the lives of people in crisis-affected areas, and what solutions should be pursued and supported by humanitarian actors from the point of view of local actors and affected people. The assessment would also aim to identify geographical areas and population groups that are particularly impacted by the crisis and whose needs and priorities should be monitored more closely by the response. REACH also proposes to collaborate with OCHA / the ISCG in country to facilitate a joint analysis session once preliminary findings are available, involving both the conventional coordination and response actors, such as ISCG members and key operational agency representatives, and local civil society organizations, including women-led groups, organizations of persons with disabilities (OPD), older people’s associations (OPA), and others.\r\nThe proposed activities are based on discussions with key actors operating in the country (OCHA, WFP, NGO consortia). Activities are also based on REACH’s previous experience responding to over 30 humanitarian crises and addressing critical information gaps in similar crises to Sri Lanka, including a growing portfolio of activities focusing on amplifying community voices through community engagement, as well as accountability to affected people."

            "The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) faces one of the world’s most complex and long-standing humanitarian crises. In 2020, the country saw COVID-19 exacerbating existing vulnerabilities alongside a resurgence in armed conflict and violence, and 27 million people are currently in dire need of protection and humanitarian assistance (Humanitarian Needs Overview, 2022) - an increase of more than 5 million, especially due to the IPC food insecurity analysis. A combination of protracted conflict in parts of the country and additional shocks, including natural disasters and epidemics, has resulted in high sustained levels of humanitarian needs and large-scale population movement, with 5.7 million people affected by population movements in DRC, according to the 2022 HNO. \r\nIn light of this fluid context, in particular in provinces in eastern DRC, where new shocks regularly lead to shifting needs and population movement, emergency programming including through rapid response mechanisms, such as those funded by FCDO. An FCDO-funded ODI publication identified an increasing trend of cash and voucher programming in the DRC humanitarian response. There is a lack of independent verification of large-scale humanitarian interventions to ensure quality, appropriate design, and impact on affected communities. Moreover, humanitarian assistance delivered to vulnerable populations in DRC, including through rapid response mechanisms and cash modalities, suffered from various aid integrity risks, as found in the Humanitarian Country Team and Joint Anti‐Fraud Taskforce-commissioned Operational Review, published in July 2020. Aid integrity has been found to be a significant issue within the DRC humanitarian response, with exposure of fraud and sexual exploitation cases. Despite efforts made by humanitarian actors, the review outlines a number of gaps and measures that would decrease the occurrence of fraudulent systems. \r\nThird Party Monitoring (TPM) is referenced in the review as one of the potential avenues mitigating the challenges of monitoring and evaluating programme implementation in high risk contexts. For the year to March 2022, IMPACT Initiatives has been delivering a Third Party Monitoring (TPM) pilot of selected FCDO-funded humanitarian interventions of the World Food Programme (WFP) and two partners under the SAFER (Strategic Assistance for Humanitarian Response in DRC) consortium partners (Mercy Corps and Solidarités International). In line with the overall sector focus as well as the identification of risks, this TPM has focused on cash and transfer interventions, especially those taking place in harder-to-reach locations. This current TPM is set to include six visits with resulting reports including practical recommendations, as well as an overall thematic piece on Accountability to Affected Populations."

          "The ongoing humanitarian response has predominantly focused on relatively secure and accessible locations such as Maiduguri and other Local Government Area (LGA) capitals (e.g. Monguno, Bama, Gwoza, Mubi). However, almost 1 million people are believed to reside in inaccessible areas outside these towns, where persistent insecurity makes consistent humanitarian access challenging (HRP 2018). \r\nYears of conflict have disrupted agricultural activity, market functionality, and supply routes, leading to dire nutrition and food security conditions - an estimated 3.7 million and 3.5 million people to be in need of food and supplementary nutrition assistance, respectively. Borno State faces a particularly challenging food security situation, where 36% of the population are projected to face crisis or emergency phases of food and nutrition security from June-August 2018 (Cadre Harmonise, October 2017).\r\nDisplaced, non-displaced and returnee populations also face a deeply difficult protection situation, with the 2018 HRP estimating 5.8 million people in need of assistance. Protection concerns are wide-ranging, including conflict-related violence, gender-based violence, family separation, forced marriage, child marriage, forced displacement, arbitrary detention, seizure of belongings, and abduction. The protection threats facing populations are likely to be most acute in inaccessible rural areas with significant Armed Opposition Group (AOG) presence. A February 2018 REACH assessment focussing on recent displacement into the town of Pulka (Gwoza LGA, Borno State) found that, prior to escaping, civilians had been forcibly held captive in their villages for months by AOGs, who threatened them with beatings or execution if they tried to escape and frequently seized their harvests.": 1,

Missing Maps is an open, collaborative project designed to map areas where humanitarian organizations are working to address the needs of people living at risk of disasters and crises.

Therefore, unmet needs and vulnerability are exceedingly high, with a predicted 6.3 million people in need of humanitarian assistance across the country in 2019. \r\n\r\nDespite substantial improvements in the availability and quality of assessment data in Afghanistan, important gaps in terms of coordinating, analysing, and using this data - to inform the humanitarian response - remain\r\n\r\nIn 2018, the humanitarian community recognised the need for comprehensive, comparative and representative data, to appropriately respond to Afghanistan’s complex needs. This resulted in the first Whole of Afghanistan Assessment (WoAA). The WoAA was designed to increase humanitarian organisations’ understanding of the multi-sector needs and vulnerabilities of different population groups across Afghanistan by providing multi-sector baseline information for the 2019 Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) and for any subsequent adjustments in programming required to the current Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) (2018-2021). This assessment took substantial steps to ‘Improve Joint and Impartial Needs Assessments’, as outlined in the Grand Bargain Agenda, by strengthening last year’s evidence-base used by the humanitarian community, which previously depended upon heavily localised and not statistically sound data, resulting in the limited capacity of findings to determine priorities and guide planning"

            "The ongoing humanitarian response has predominantly focused on relatively secure and accessible locations such as Maiduguri and other Local Government Area (LGA) capitals (e.g. Monguno, Bama, Gwoza, Mubi). However, almost 1 million people are believed to reside in inaccessible areas outside these towns, where persistent insecurity makes consistent humanitarian access challenging (HRP 2018). \r\nYears of conflict have disrupted agricultural activity, market functionality, and supply routes, leading to dire nutrition and food security conditions - an estimated 3.7 million and 3.5 million people to be in need of food and supplementary nutrition assistance, respectively. Borno State faces a particularly challenging food security situation, where 36% of the population are projected to face crisis or emergency phases of food and nutrition security from June-August 2018 (Cadre Harmonise, October 2017).\r\nDisplaced, non-displaced and returnee populations also face a deeply difficult protection situation, with the 2018 HRP estimating 5.8 million people in need of assistance. Protection concerns are wide-ranging, including conflict-related violence, gender-based violence, family separation, forced marriage, child marriage, forced displacement, arbitrary detention, seizure of belongings, and abduction. The protection threats facing populations are likely to be most acute in inaccessible rural areas with significant Armed Opposition Group (AOG) presence. A February 2018 REACH assessment focussing on recent displacement into the town of Pulka (Gwoza LGA, Borno State) found that, prior to escaping, civilians had been forcibly held captive in their villages for months by AOGs, who threatened them with beatings or execution if they tried to escape and frequently seized their harvests."

In working with a wide variety of partners within a recognized coordination structure, REACH ensures a broad impact across the humanitarian response, building the capacity of partners to collect and utilize data. In addition, enhancing the capacity of coordination partners to facilitate data collection and analysis creates a higher level of buy-in from Cluster and Working Group partners, ensuring increased levels of collaboration.

REACH proposes a multi-pronged approach to fill information management gaps and enhance the response and prioritisation of humanitarian and government actors in all three drought affected countries. In Kenya REACH will conduct an assessment in Turkana and Marsabit counties, which are hard-hit by the drought and considered to be candidates to potentially deteriorate into IPC Phase 4 levels of food insecurity. REACH will provide a multi-sectoral lens to the National Drought Management Authority’s (NDMA) food security findings, to encourage implementing actors to take an integrated approach to humanitarian activities to minimise the risk of excess mortality. Under the proposed project’s second objective, REACH will strengthen the analysis and remote sensing capacity of its existing activities, to provide granular data culminating in an analysis output that highlights most vulnerable populations across all three countries."

            "The humanitarian response is South Sudan is faced with two central issues in terms of information management: 1) ability to regularly monitor humanitarian needs due to accessibility and security issues, inhibiting humanitarian planning and linked to this 2) the ability to effectively prioritise humanitarian assistance, which is becoming ever more urgent in the context of humanitarian needs increasing in severity and in geographic scale. To fill these identified information management gaps, REACH has been collaborating closely and feeding information into the humanitarian architecture in South Sudan to support in tracking of humanitarian needs. Primarily this has been conducted through its AoK remote monitoring (please see Section 4.5) and subsequent information sharing and collaboration with the clusters, the Inter-Cluster Working Group (ICWG) and the Integrated Phase Classification Technical Working Group (IPC TWG). To support improvements in the emergency response prioritization process, in early 2018, REACH played a central role in pushing for shifts in the humanitarian architecture to improve real-time analysis and evidence-based decision making through the set up and co-chairing of the Needs Analysis Working Group (NAWG), tasked with supporting ICWG in emergency response prioritization, and the development of the Integrated Needs Tracking System (INT), tasked by the FSL, WASH, Health and Nutrition clusters to develop an integrated needs monitoring system to support the clusters in prioritizing emergency areas for famine prevention responses."

The IPC from October 2018 estimated 59% of South Sudan’s population to face crisis, emergency and catastrophic food insecurity, which makes evidence-based targeting of existing funds a critical necessity to save lives potentially at risk. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, the dynamic and multi-faceted nature of the South Sudan crisis has created significant challenges for humanitarian information management. Accessibility and security issues within South Sudan have impeded systematic direct data collection efforts – limiting the ability to monitor needs and therefore provide timely information for effective targeting inside the country. As a result, it is becoming increasingly important to adopt adaptive and innovative approaches to filling information gaps in a systematic manner to promote more effective humanitarian response and planning."

            "As of July 2022, Sri Lanka is facing an economic crisis rooted in high inflation, fuel shortages and low foreign exchange reserves. The UN Humanitarian Needs and Priorities (HNP) Plan (launched 09 June) estimated 5.7 people in need.   \r\nWhile many, including WFP and FAO , expect a deterioration of the situation, there is still an absence of critical sources of information on community priorities in terms of humanitarian assistance as well as perceptions of ongoing programming among affected people. Moreover, humanitarian decision makers are faced with a critical gap of information on the differential impact of the crisis on various groups of people, especially in terms of how the compounding multi-dimensional crisis is exacerbating pre-existing vulnerabilities through a loss of access to resources and reduction in access to essential services among persons with disabilities, older people, female-headed households, persons with critical illnesses and others.\r\nTo support response actors to prioritize and plan with enhanced awareness of community preferences in terms of humanitarian assistance and modalities of assistance, REACH  proposes to launch a participatory assessment focused on Accountability to Affected People. The assessment will seek community triangulation of the assumptions that underly the current humanitarian response in terms of what the drivers of the crisis are, how the crisis is impacting the lives of people in crisis-affected areas, and what solutions should be pursued and supported by humanitarian actors from the point of view of local actors and affected people. The assessment would also aim to identify geographical areas and population groups that are particularly impacted by the crisis and whose needs and priorities should be monitored more closely by the response. REACH also proposes to collaborate with OCHA / the ISCG in country to facilitate a joint analysis session once preliminary findings are available, involving both the conventional coordination and response actors, such as ISCG members and key operational agency representatives, and local civil society organizations, including women-led groups, organizations of persons with disabilities (OPD), older people’s associations (OPA), and others.\r\nThe proposed activities are based on discussions with key actors operating in the country (OCHA, WFP, NGO consortia). Activities are also based on REACH’s previous experience responding to over 30 humanitarian crises and addressing critical information gaps in similar crises to Sri Lanka, including a growing portfolio of activities focusing on amplifying community voices through community engagement, as well as accountability to affected people."

            "The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) faces one of the world’s most complex and long-standing humanitarian crises. In 2020, the country saw COVID-19 exacerbating existing vulnerabilities alongside a resurgence in armed conflict and violence, and 27 million people are currently in dire need of protection and humanitarian assistance (Humanitarian Needs Overview, 2022) - an increase of more than 5 million, especially due to the IPC food insecurity analysis. A combination of protracted conflict in parts of the country and additional shocks, including natural disasters and epidemics, has resulted in high sustained levels of humanitarian needs and large-scale population movement, with 5.7 million people affected by population movements in DRC, according to the 2022 HNO. \r\nIn light of this fluid context, in particular in provinces in eastern DRC, where new shocks regularly lead to shifting needs and population movement, emergency programming including through rapid response mechanisms, such as those funded by FCDO. An FCDO-funded ODI publication identified an increasing trend of cash and voucher programming in the DRC humanitarian response. There is a lack of independent verification of large-scale humanitarian interventions to ensure quality, appropriate design, and impact on affected communities. Moreover, humanitarian assistance delivered to vulnerable populations in DRC, including through rapid response mechanisms and cash modalities, suffered from various aid integrity risks, as found in the Humanitarian Country Team and Joint Anti‐Fraud Taskforce-commissioned Operational Review, published in July 2020. Aid integrity has been found to be a significant issue within the DRC humanitarian response, with exposure of fraud and sexual exploitation cases. Despite efforts made by humanitarian actors, the review outlines a number of gaps and measures that would decrease the occurrence of fraudulent systems. \r\nThird Party Monitoring (TPM) is referenced in the review as one of the potential avenues mitigating the challenges of monitoring and evaluating programme implementation in high risk contexts. For the year to March 2022, IMPACT Initiatives has been delivering a Third Party Monitoring (TPM) pilot of selected FCDO-funded humanitarian interventions of the World Food Programme (WFP) and two partners under the SAFER (Strategic Assistance for Humanitarian Response in DRC) consortium partners (Mercy Corps and Solidarités International). In line with the overall sector focus as well as the identification of risks, this TPM has focused on cash and transfer interventions, especially those taking place in harder-to-reach locations. This current TPM is set to include six visits with resulting reports including practical recommendations, as well as an overall thematic piece on Accountability to Affected Populations."

          "The ongoing humanitarian response has predominantly focused on relatively secure and accessible locations such as Maiduguri and other Local Government Area (LGA) capitals (e.g. Monguno, Bama, Gwoza, Mubi). However, almost 1 million people are believed to reside in inaccessible areas outside these towns, where persistent insecurity makes consistent humanitarian access challenging (HRP 2018). \r\nYears of conflict have disrupted agricultural activity, market functionality, and supply routes, leading to dire nutrition and food security conditions - an estimated 3.7 million and 3.5 million people to be in need of food and supplementary nutrition assistance, respectively. Borno State faces a particularly challenging food security situation, where 36% of the population are projected to face crisis or emergency phases of food and nutrition security from June-August 2018 (Cadre Harmonise, October 2017).\r\nDisplaced, non-displaced and returnee populations also face a deeply difficult protection situation, with the 2018 HRP estimating 5.8 million people in need of assistance. Protection concerns are wide-ranging, including conflict-related violence, gender-based violence, family separation, forced marriage, child marriage, forced displacement, arbitrary detention, seizure of belongings, and abduction. The protection threats facing populations are likely to be most acute in inaccessible rural areas with significant Armed Opposition Group (AOG) presence. A February 2018 REACH assessment focussing on recent displacement into the town of Pulka (Gwoza LGA, Borno State) found that, prior to escaping, civilians had been forcibly held captive in their villages for months by AOGs, who threatened them with beatings or execution if they tried to escape and frequently seized their harvests.": 1,

            "UNESCO has applied for funds to support an extention of the 'Strengthening  HIV prevention  amongst young people through promoting  comprehensive sexuality education in Eastern and Southern Africa Project' , to increase the implementation period to 12 months from 1 January 2016 to 31 December, 2016.  The purpose of the project is to increase children and young people's knowledge on sexual and reproductive health and rights through access to high quality  comprehensive sexuality education that is gender transformative, evidence informed and age and culturally appropriate. UNESCO has requested for a total amount of MSEK15. The proposal is to support the expansion and strengthening of activities that have been undertaken from 2012 to 2015. The activities are expected to bring an important information and knowledge gap that is essential for young people to address the sexual and reproductive health needs as well as make important decisions regarding their sexuality.  The project which has been implemented since 2012 was designed to offer support to 10 countries in total to carry out specific activities according to each country's needs. Two countries were added to the project during 2015. The conceptual framework of the project is such that it operates on five (5) key dimensions of project implementation, which are expected to lead to the achievement of the overall project objective which is 'increasing children and young people's knowledge  on sexual and reproductive health and rights  through access to high quality  CSE that is gender transformative, evidence informed and age appropriate’.  The project has thus far been working towards securing high level political support for the provision  of CSE in the education sector and mostly through activities of the ESA commitment; to strengthen  policies and systems for the delivery of CSE at school level by building  the capacity  of the stakeholders in the education  sector to plan, manage and monitor CSE programmes adequately; mainstreaming  CSE in curricula; increasing capacity  of the teachers within the education sector to deliver CSE programmes confidently; and engaging communities through community engagement programmes. During the extension period, UNESCO has proposed focusing only on four of the five objectives of the project, thereby leaving out objective three which was focusing on curricula development which most countries have been able to progress well with. \nUNESCO will during this extension period also carry out a project evaluation which had not been planned for in the earlier project period. This will provide an opportunity to make an assessment of the achievements of the project and to position this work in other regional interventions on SRHR. \nThe project will continue to work in all the countries as follows: Focus countries: Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Sudan, Nambia, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia and Networking countries: Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe.",
            "UNESCO har ansökt om medel för en förlängning av projektet, “Strengthening HIV prevention amongst young people through promoting comprehensive sexuality education is Eastern and Southern Africa Project”. Förlängningen om 12 månader avser perioden 1 januari – 31 december 2016. Syftet med projektet är att öka barn och ungas kunskap och sexuell och reproduktiv hälsa och rättigheter genom tillgång till evidensbaserad och genus-, kultur- och åldersanpassad sexualundervisning av god kvalitet.\nUNESCO har ansökt om totalt 15 miljoner kronor för att utöka och stärka de aktiviteter som genomförts under perioden 2012-2015. Aktiviteterna förväntas överbrygga informations- och kunskapsbrister som är nödvändiga för att unga ska kunna hantera sina behov inom sexuell och reproduktiv hälsa samt för att de ska kunna ta viktiga beslut gällande sin sexualitet. \nProjektet har pågått sedan 2012 och har utformats för att ge stöd till totalt 10 länder. Aktiviteterna har anpassats efter varje lands specifika behov. Ytterligare två länder tillkom under 2015. Det övergripande ramverket för projektet täcker in fem (5) dimensioner. Ramverket ska bidra till uppfyllelse av det övergripande målet om att öka barn och ungas kunskap och sexuell och reproduktiv hälsa och rättigheter genom tillgång till evidensbaserad och genus-, kultur- och åldersanpassad sexualundervisning av god kvalitet.\nProjektet har så här långt arbetat med att mobilisera politiskt stöd på högsta nivå för sexualundervisning inom utbildningsområdet. Framför allt genom aktiviteter med stöd av det så kallade ”ESA-åtagandet” som betonar; stärkande av policy och system för sexualundervisning i skolor genom utvecklad kapacitet hos intressenter inom utbildningssektorn vad gäller planering, styrning och uppföljning av sexualundervisningsinsatser; mainstreaming av sexualundervisning i läroplaner; öka lärarnas kapacitet för att tillhandahålla sexualundervisning; samt involvera samhället genom ”community engagement programmes”. Under förlängningsperioden föreslår UNESCO att projektet fokuserar på fyra av de ursprungliga fem målen. Mål nummer tre, som fokuserar på utveckling av läroplaner, utelämnas eftersom de flesta länderna har gjort framsteg inom detta område.\nUNESCO kommer under förlängningsperioden också att genomföra en projektutvärdering vilket inte var planerat för tidigare. Utvärderingen ger tillfälle att bedöma måluppfyllelsen av projektet samt jämföra med arbetet med andra regionala SRHR-insatser. \nProjektet kommer att fortsatt arbeta inom följande fokusländer: Lesotho, Malawi, Moçambique, Sydsudan, Namibia, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia och följande nätverksländer: Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Etiopien, Kenya, Rwanda, Sydafrika, Swaziland and Zimbabwe.",
            "The project intends to increase children and young people's knowledge on sexual and reproductive  health and rights through access to high quality , comprehensive sexuality education that is gender transformative, evidence informed and age and culturally appropriate. The project acknowledges that while the education sector has a key role in equipping young people with the knowledge, skills and attitudes that lead to the development of healthy behaviour, they alone cannot meet all the sexual and reproductive health needs of young people. The project therefore proposes close work linkage with the health sector to ensure that comprehensive sexuality education  provided in schools is complemented by the provision of youth friendly health services in order to achieve better sexual and reproductive health outcomes, including strengthened HIV prevention for young people in the region. By adopting a regional approach, the project will promote greater efficiency, collaboration and networking between countries. Additionally the countries involved will also benefit from regional cross learning and sharing, ensuring that the best practices are quickly used and adopted."

            "United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) är en organisation som bl.a. arbetar med globala frågor inom utbildning. Sidastödet är ett tematiskt stöd för utbildningssektorn med mjuk öronmärkning och är samfinansierat med främst de nordiska länderna för genomförande av UNESCO Medium-Term Strategy för 2014-2021 (37 C/4) och Programme and Budget för 2014-2017 (37 C/5). UNESCO är en global organisation som främst arbetar på global nivå. När verksamheten rör landsamarbeten avser det länder som är bland världens fattigaste. Då det svenska stödet till UNESCO är ett tematiskt stöd med mjuk öronmärkning så ger det UNESCO ökade möjligheter till intern effektivitet. Valet av stödform är i enlighet med Svensk strategi för multilateralt utvecklingssamarbete. Målen för insatsen är dels att stärka UNESCOs roll som ledare inom FN för programmet Education for All (EFA) och uppnå EFA målet om allas rätt till utbildning, samt driva de svenska prioriterade frågorna om ökad effektivisering genom system för resultatbaserad styrning och införa effektiva prioriteringsprocesser. Sida skall också verka för ökad givarkoordinering inom UNESCOs utbildningssektor.\n\nSverige kommer att stödja UNESCOs arbete för utbildning med 280 miljoner SEK, med en första utbetalning 2014 som är det första året för UNESCOs nya strategiska plan, program och budget. Det svenska stödet till UNESCO Education Sector (ED) om 70 miljoner kronor/år från Sidas enhet för globala program (GLOBPRO) för 2014-2017 fördelas enligt 20 miljoner kronor/år till IIEP (International Institute for Educational Planning), 10 miljoner kronor/år till UIL (Institute for Lifelong Learning), 5 miljoner kronor/år till UIS (Institute for Statistics), 20 miljoner kronor/år till CapEFA (Capacity Development for Education for All), 5 miljoner kronor/år till GMR (Education for All Global Monitoring Report), 5 miljoner kronor/år till Forecasting/Research (Global report on Rethinking Learning in a Complex world), och 5 miljoner kronor/år till Sexuality education.\n\nDe komparativa fördelarna med att Sida stödjer UNESCO Education Sector (ED) är att:\n- UNESCO är FNs fackorgan med ansvar för utbildningsfrågor. \n- UNESCO har mandat att leda arbetet med utbildning för alla (EFA, Education For All) som är en global strategi i samverkan med UNICEF, UNDP, Världsbanken och UNFPA. EFA målet är att alla barn, unga och vuxna skall få utbildning senast år 2015. UNESCO koordinerar de internationella ansträngningarna att nå målet om utbildning för alla (EFA). \n- UNESCO är värd för den arbetsgrupp som framställer den normativt viktiga EFA GMR rapporten.\n- några av  UNESCOs arbetsområden inom utbildning är väldigt specialiserade och är därför tämligen unika, t.ex., arbetet på IIEP, UIS och GMR, samt med EFA koordinering.\n- det globala normativa stödet till UNESCO ses som ett viktigt komplement till Sidas övriga stora insatser för implementering av utbildning, t.ex., Global Partnership for Education (GPE), olika Unicef program, etc.\nDärför bedömer Sida att organisationen är viktig för globalt normativt arbete.\n\nStödet kommer att följas upp genom Sidas reguljära insatshanteringsuppföljning som baseras på UNESCOs årliga rapportering mot resultatramverket. Utöver detta kommer stödet följas upp genom Sveriges medlemskap i UNESCOs styrelse som sammanträder flera gånger per år och där frågor relevanta för stödet kan tas upp vid behov. Sida bedömer därför att det finns goda kanaler och forum för att följa upp och driva frågor. Det svenska UNESCO rådet på Utbildningsdepartementet tar fram de generella Svenska dialogfrågorna i samråd med UD, Sida och andra relevanta svenska aktörer. Sveriges representant i Unescos styrelse är för närvarande Amelie von Zweigbergk.\n\nInsatsen bedöms relevant för barn och kvinnor och i enlighet med Resultatstrategi för globala insatser för socialt hållbar utveckling 2014-2017 samt Strategin för Sveriges samarbete med Unesco 2014-2017. Utöver stödets generella betydelse för utbildningssektorn så bedöms stödet vara relevant för att åstadkomma universell grundutbildning (MDG 2) och jämställdhet mellan kvinnor och män i utbildning (MDG3/Target 3). Stödet är även relevant för de sex målen för utbildning för alla/ Education For All (EFA).\n\nResultatet av beredningen är att UNESCO bedöms ha tillräckligt bra system för att bedriva ett rättighetsbaserat angreppssätt i sina program. Detta innebär att UNESCO inkluderar principer för icke-diskriminering, transparens, deltagande och ansvarsutkrävande. De inkluderar även jämställdhet och miljömässig medvetenhet. UNESCO bedöms ha tillräckliga regelverk, instruktioner och verktyg för att integrera dessa aspekter i arbetet. Sida har tagit del av olika tillgängliga bedömningar som gjorts av UNESCO, t.ex., Sveriges organisationsbedömning av UNESCO (2012), UK review Multilateral Aid Review/MAR (2013), Norsk samarbeid med UNESCO (2011), Independent external evaluation of UNESCO (2010), Evaluation of UNESCO education sector (2009), Review of IIEP (2013), Review of UIL (2013), Evaluation of CapEFA (2013) och Evaluation of GMR (2014).\n\nUtöver att vara en aktör som bedöms ha kapacitet att leverera resultat, bedöms UNESCO också vara relevant för Sida på grund av sin roll i globala normativa forum. UNESCO är viktig för uppföljningen av MDG-målen för utbildning. Dessa aspekter bedöms ge stödet ökat värde för Sida. Sida anser dock att det finns utrymme för förbättringar vad gäller rapportering av hur dessa aspekter implementeras i utförandet av arbetet. Specifika frågor, så som stärkt resultatbaserad styrning och rapportering, kommer därför följas upp under insatsen genom dialog.\n\nDet bedöms också att UNESCO som organisation strävar efter att reformera sig och att förbättra sin kostnadseffektivitet på flera nivåer. Sidas ambition är att under nästa möjliga avtalsperiod, dvs för år 2018 och framåt, fortsätta minska fragmenteringen av det svenska stödet till UNESCO Education Sector (ED). Sida kommer därför fortsätta att sträva mot ett helt sammanhållet icke-öronmärkt stöd till UNESCO, exempelvis liknande Sidas nuvarande stöd till WHO eller Unicef.\n\nÖvrigt Svenskt stöd till UNESCO består bla av följande planerade Sidainsatser:\n- För 2014-2017 avser Sidas enhet för demokrati och mänskliga rättigheter (Demo/MR) besluta om ett stöd till UNESCO Communication and Information sector (CI)/Culture Sector (CLT) om ca 20 miljoner kronor/år. \n- För 2014-2017 avser Sidas enhet för forskningsamarbete (FORSK) besluta om ett stöd till Natural Sciences Sector (SC) med ca 10 miljoner kronor/år.\n\nÖvrigt: Det har konstaterats att de tidigare avtalsmallarna med UNESCO är svaga. Sidas enhet för Juridik (JUR) och UNESCO har därför förhandlat fram en slutversion av nya bättre avtalsmallar. De nya mallarna skall användas för denna insats.",

            "UNESCO has applied for funds to support an extention of the 'Strengthening  HIV prevention  amongst young people through promoting  comprehensive sexuality education in Eastern and Southern Africa Project' , to increase the implementation period to 12 months from 1 January 2016 to 31 December, 2016.  The purpose of the project is to increase children and young people's knowledge on sexual and reproductive health and rights through access to high quality  comprehensive sexuality education that is gender transformative, evidence informed and age and culturally appropriate. UNESCO has requested for a total amount of MSEK15. The proposal is to support the expansion and strengthening of activities that have been undertaken from 2012 to 2015. The activities are expected to bring an important information and knowledge gap that is essential for young people to address the sexual and reproductive health needs as well as make important decisions regarding their sexuality.  The project which has been implemented since 2012 was designed to offer support to 10 countries in total to carry out specific activities according to each country's needs. Two countries were added to the project during 2015. The conceptual framework of the project is such that it operates on five (5) key dimensions of project implementation, which are expected to lead to the achievement of the overall project objective which is 'increasing children and young people's knowledge  on sexual and reproductive health and rights  through access to high quality  CSE that is gender transformative, evidence informed and age appropriate’.  The project has thus far been working towards securing high level political support for the provision  of CSE in the education sector and mostly through activities of the ESA commitment; to strengthen  policies and systems for the delivery of CSE at school level by building  the capacity  of the stakeholders in the education  sector to plan, manage and monitor CSE programmes adequately; mainstreaming  CSE in curricula; increasing capacity  of the teachers within the education sector to deliver CSE programmes confidently; and engaging communities through community engagement programmes. During the extension period, UNESCO has proposed focusing only on four of the five objectives of the project, thereby leaving out objective three which was focusing on curricula development which most countries have been able to progress well with. \nUNESCO will during this extension period also carry out a project evaluation which had not been planned for in the earlier project period. This will provide an opportunity to make an assessment of the achievements of the project and to position this work in other regional interventions on SRHR. \nThe project will continue to work in all the countries as follows: Focus countries: Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Sudan, Nambia, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia and Networking countries: Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe.",
            "UNESCO har ansökt om medel för en förlängning av projektet, “Strengthening HIV prevention amongst young people through promoting comprehensive sexuality education is Eastern and Southern Africa Project”. Förlängningen om 12 månader avser perioden 1 januari – 31 december 2016. Syftet med projektet är att öka barn och ungas kunskap och sexuell och reproduktiv hälsa och rättigheter genom tillgång till evidensbaserad och genus-, kultur- och åldersanpassad sexualundervisning av god kvalitet.\nUNESCO har ansökt om totalt 15 miljoner kronor för att utöka och stärka de aktiviteter som genomförts under perioden 2012-2015. Aktiviteterna förväntas överbrygga informations- och kunskapsbrister som är nödvändiga för att unga ska kunna hantera sina behov inom sexuell och reproduktiv hälsa samt för att de ska kunna ta viktiga beslut gällande sin sexualitet. \nProjektet har pågått sedan 2012 och har utformats för att ge stöd till totalt 10 länder. Aktiviteterna har anpassats efter varje lands specifika behov. Ytterligare två länder tillkom under 2015. Det övergripande ramverket för projektet täcker in fem (5) dimensioner. Ramverket ska bidra till uppfyllelse av det övergripande målet om att öka barn och ungas kunskap och sexuell och reproduktiv hälsa och rättigheter genom tillgång till evidensbaserad och genus-, kultur- och åldersanpassad sexualundervisning av god kvalitet.\nProjektet har så här långt arbetat med att mobilisera politiskt stöd på högsta nivå för sexualundervisning inom utbildningsområdet. Framför allt genom aktiviteter med stöd av det så kallade ”ESA-åtagandet” som betonar; stärkande av policy och system för sexualundervisning i skolor genom utvecklad kapacitet hos intressenter inom utbildningssektorn vad gäller planering, styrning och uppföljning av sexualundervisningsinsatser; mainstreaming av sexualundervisning i läroplaner; öka lärarnas kapacitet för att tillhandahålla sexualundervisning; samt involvera samhället genom ”community engagement programmes”. Under förlängningsperioden föreslår UNESCO att projektet fokuserar på fyra av de ursprungliga fem målen. Mål nummer tre, som fokuserar på utveckling av läroplaner, utelämnas eftersom de flesta länderna har gjort framsteg inom detta område.\nUNESCO kommer under förlängningsperioden också att genomföra en projektutvärdering vilket inte var planerat för tidigare. Utvärderingen ger tillfälle att bedöma måluppfyllelsen av projektet samt jämföra med arbetet med andra regionala SRHR-insatser. \nProjektet kommer att fortsatt arbeta inom följande fokusländer: Lesotho, Malawi, Moçambique, Sydsudan, Namibia, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia och följande nätverksländer: Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Etiopien, Kenya, Rwanda, Sydafrika, Swaziland and Zimbabwe.",
            "The project intends to increase children and young people's knowledge on sexual and reproductive  health and rights through access to high quality , comprehensive sexuality education that is gender transformative, evidence informed and age and culturally appropriate. The project acknowledges that while the education sector has a key role in equipping young people with the knowledge, skills and attitudes that lead to the development of healthy behaviour, they alone cannot meet all the sexual and reproductive health needs of young people. The project therefore proposes close work linkage with the health sector to ensure that comprehensive sexuality education  provided in schools is complemented by the provision of youth friendly health services in order to achieve better sexual and reproductive health outcomes, including strengthened HIV prevention for young people in the region. By adopting a regional approach, the project will promote greater efficiency, collaboration and networking between countries. Additionally the countries involved will also benefit from regional cross learning and sharing, ensuring that the best practices are quickly used and adopted."

            "The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization  (UNESCO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations (UN). Its      purpose is to contribute to peace and security by promoting           international collaboration through education, science, and culture.   Sidas support to UNESCO is focused on one of the organisations five  programs: education.",
            "United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) är en organisation som bl.a. arbetar med globala frågor inom utbildning. Sidastödet är ett tematiskt stöd för utbildningssektorn med mjuk öronmärkning och är samfinansierat med främst de nordiska länderna för genomförande av UNESCO Medium-Term Strategy för 2014-2021 (37 C/4) och Programme and Budget för 2014-2017 (37 C/5). UNESCO är en global organisation som främst arbetar på global nivå. När verksamheten rör landsamarbeten avser det länder som är bland världens fattigaste. Då det svenska stödet till UNESCO är ett tematiskt stöd med mjuk öronmärkning så ger det UNESCO ökade möjligheter till intern effektivitet. Valet av stödform är i enlighet med Svensk strategi för multilateralt utvecklingssamarbete. Målen för insatsen är dels att stärka UNESCOs roll som ledare inom FN för programmet Education for All (EFA) och uppnå EFA målet om allas rätt till utbildning, samt driva de svenska prioriterade frågorna om ökad effektivisering genom system för resultatbaserad styrning och införa effektiva prioriteringsprocesser. Sida skall också verka för ökad givarkoordinering inom UNESCOs utbildningssektor.\n\nSverige kommer att stödja UNESCOs arbete för utbildning med 280 miljoner SEK, med en första utbetalning 2014 som är det första året för UNESCOs nya strategiska plan, program och budget. Det svenska stödet till UNESCO Education Sector (ED) om 70 miljoner kronor/år från Sidas enhet för globala program (GLOBPRO) för 2014-2017 fördelas enligt 20 miljoner kronor/år till IIEP (International Institute for Educational Planning), 10 miljoner kronor/år till UIL (Institute for Lifelong Learning), 5 miljoner kronor/år till UIS (Institute for Statistics), 20 miljoner kronor/år till CapEFA (Capacity Development for Education for All), 5 miljoner kronor/år till GMR (Education for All Global Monitoring Report), 5 miljoner kronor/år till Forecasting/Research (Global report on Rethinking Learning in a Complex world), och 5 miljoner kronor/år till Sexuality education.\n\nDe komparativa fördelarna med att Sida stödjer UNESCO Education Sector (ED) är att:\n- UNESCO är FNs fackorgan med ansvar för utbildningsfrågor. \n- UNESCO har mandat att leda arbetet med utbildning för alla (EFA, Education For All) som är en global strategi i samverkan med UNICEF, UNDP, Världsbanken och UNFPA. EFA målet är att alla barn, unga och vuxna skall få utbildning senast år 2015. UNESCO koordinerar de internationella ansträngningarna att nå målet om utbildning för alla (EFA). \n- UNESCO är värd för den arbetsgrupp som framställer den normativt viktiga EFA GMR rapporten.\n- några av  UNESCOs arbetsområden inom utbildning är väldigt specialiserade och är därför tämligen unika, t.ex., arbetet på IIEP, UIS och GMR, samt med EFA koordinering.\n- det globala normativa stödet till UNESCO ses som ett viktigt komplement till Sidas övriga stora insatser för implementering av utbildning, t.ex., Global Partnership for Education (GPE), olika Unicef program, etc.\nDärför bedömer Sida att organisationen är viktig för globalt normativt arbete.\n\nStödet kommer att följas upp genom Sidas reguljära insatshanteringsuppföljning som baseras på UNESCOs årliga rapportering mot resultatramverket. Utöver detta kommer stödet följas upp genom Sveriges medlemskap i UNESCOs styrelse som sammanträder flera gånger per år och där frågor relevanta för stödet kan tas upp vid behov. Sida bedömer därför att det finns goda kanaler och forum för att följa upp och driva frågor. Det svenska UNESCO rådet på Utbildningsdepartementet tar fram de generella Svenska dialogfrågorna i samråd med UD, Sida och andra relevanta svenska aktörer. Sveriges representant i Unescos styrelse är för närvarande Amelie von Zweigbergk.\n\nInsatsen bedöms relevant för barn och kvinnor och i enlighet med Resultatstrategi för globala insatser för socialt hållbar utveckling 2014-2017 samt Strategin för Sveriges samarbete med Unesco 2014-2017. Utöver stödets generella betydelse för utbildningssektorn så bedöms stödet vara relevant för att åstadkomma universell grundutbildning (MDG 2) och jämställdhet mellan kvinnor och män i utbildning (MDG3/Target 3). Stödet är även relevant för de sex målen för utbildning för alla/ Education For All (EFA).\n\nResultatet av beredningen är att UNESCO bedöms ha tillräckligt bra system för att bedriva ett rättighetsbaserat angreppssätt i sina program. Detta innebär att UNESCO inkluderar principer för icke-diskriminering, transparens, deltagande och ansvarsutkrävande. De inkluderar även jämställdhet och miljömässig medvetenhet. UNESCO bedöms ha tillräckliga regelverk, instruktioner och verktyg för att integrera dessa aspekter i arbetet. Sida har tagit del av olika tillgängliga bedömningar som gjorts av UNESCO, t.ex., Sveriges organisationsbedömning av UNESCO (2012), UK review Multilateral Aid Review/MAR (2013), Norsk samarbeid med UNESCO (2011), Independent external evaluation of UNESCO (2010), Evaluation of UNESCO education sector (2009), Review of IIEP (2013), Review of UIL (2013), Evaluation of CapEFA (2013) och Evaluation of GMR (2014).\n\nUtöver att vara en aktör som bedöms ha kapacitet att leverera resultat, bedöms UNESCO också vara relevant för Sida på grund av sin roll i globala normativa forum. UNESCO är viktig för uppföljningen av MDG-målen för utbildning. Dessa aspekter bedöms ge stödet ökat värde för Sida. Sida anser dock att det finns utrymme för förbättringar vad gäller rapportering av hur dessa aspekter implementeras i utförandet av arbetet. Specifika frågor, så som stärkt resultatbaserad styrning och rapportering, kommer därför följas upp under insatsen genom dialog.\n\nDet bedöms också att UNESCO som organisation strävar efter att reformera sig och att förbättra sin kostnadseffektivitet på flera nivåer. Sidas ambition är att under nästa möjliga avtalsperiod, dvs för år 2018 och framåt, fortsätta minska fragmenteringen av det svenska stödet till UNESCO Education Sector (ED). Sida kommer därför fortsätta att sträva mot ett helt sammanhållet icke-öronmärkt stöd till UNESCO, exempelvis liknande Sidas nuvarande stöd till WHO eller Unicef.\n\nÖvrigt Svenskt stöd till UNESCO består bla av följande planerade Sidainsatser:\n- För 2014-2017 avser Sidas enhet för demokrati och mänskliga rättigheter (Demo/MR) besluta om ett stöd till UNESCO Communication and Information sector (CI)/Culture Sector (CLT) om ca 20 miljoner kronor/år. \n- För 2014-2017 avser Sidas enhet för forskningsamarbete (FORSK) besluta om ett stöd till Natural Sciences Sector (SC) med ca 10 miljoner kronor/år.\n\nÖvrigt: Det har konstaterats att de tidigare avtalsmallarna med UNESCO är svaga. Sidas enhet för Juridik (JUR) och UNESCO har därför förhandlat fram en slutversion av nya bättre avtalsmallar. De nya mallarna skall användas för denna insats.",

            "United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) är en organisation som bl.a. arbetar med globala frågor inom kommunikation och kultur. UNESCO har skickat en ansökan om stöd till Sida för organisationens arbete med utbildning (ED), kommunikation och information (CI), kultur (CLT) och forskning (SC). Sida DEMO har i bifogad bedömningspromemoria tagit ställning till ansökan om stöd till Cl- och CLT-sektorerna. Det är önskvärt att eventuellt stöd från GLOBPRO, FORSK och DEMO inkluderas inom ett och samma Programme Cooperation Agreement (PCA) med UNESCO i enlighet med bifogat avtalsutkast. \n\nDEMOs förslag till stöd till CI och CLT avser i första hand ett tematiskt stöd till de föreslagna programmen inom CI och CLT, där huvudfokus inom CI-programmet ligger på främjande av yttrandefrihet och medieutveckling och huvudfokus inom CLT-programmet ligger på främjande av yttrandefrihet genom stärkande av policys för främjande av kulturell mångfald. \n\nDe föreslagna programmen är väl förankrade i UNESCO Medium-Term Strategy för 2014-2021 (37 C/4) och Programme and Budget för 2014-2017 (37 C/5). Verksamheten är både global och landspecifik, där globala komponenter i huvudsak är normativt orienterade och komponenter på landnivå fokuserar på kapacitetsutveckling, allt emedan det finns ett sampel mellan det globala och landspecifika arbetet. I fokus för verksamhet på landnivå är länder som präglas av ett demokratisk underskott, inklusive inskränkningar inom yttrandefrihet och brist på oberoende media. \n\nGlobalt normativt inom yttrandefrihet och medieutveckling bidrar CI-programmet i huvudsak till områdena säkerhet för journalister, yttrandefrihet online och offline, media literacy samt media och jämställdhet. På landnivå bidrar programmet till UNESCOs arbete med lokal radio i Afrika samt andra landspecifika yttrandefrihetsinsatser i Afrika, MENA och Latinamerika inom lagstifnings- och påverkansarbete samt kapacitetsbyggande insatser inom ICT, media och journalistik, vilket är ett viktigt bidrag till att stärka demokratisering och yttrandefrihet i dessa länder. CLT-programmet är starkt förankrat i 2005 års UNESCO konvention för kulturell mångfald som har yttrandefrihet och jämställdhet som grundläggande principer. Kapacitetsutveckling på landnivå fokuserar på förståelse av konventionen och metoder för datainsamlig och uppföljning av konventionen, vilket bl a  inkludrerar bevakning av yttrandefrihet/kommunikation.

            "United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) är en organisation som bl.a. arbetar med globala frågor inom kommunikation och kultur. UNESCO har skickat en ansökan om stöd till Sida för organisationens arbete med utbildning (ED), kommunikation och information (CI), kultur (CLT) och forskning (SC). Sida DEMO har i bifogad bedömningspromemoria tagit ställning till ansökan om stöd till Cl- och CLT-sektorerna. Det är önskvärt att eventuellt stöd från GLOBPRO, FORSK och DEMO inkluderas inom ett och samma Programme Cooperation Agreement (PCA) med UNESCO i enlighet med bifogat avtalsutkast. \n\nDEMOs förslag till stöd till CI och CLT avser i första hand ett tematiskt stöd till de föreslagna programmen inom CI och CLT, där huvudfokus inom CI-programmet ligger på främjande av yttrandefrihet och medieutveckling och huvudfokus inom CLT-programmet ligger på främjande av yttrandefrihet genom stärkande av policys för främjande av kulturell mångfald. \n\nDe föreslagna programmen är väl förankrade i UNESCO Medium-Term Strategy för 2014-2021 (37 C/4) och Programme and Budget för 2014-2017 (37 C/5). Verksamheten är både global och landspecifik, där globala komponenter i huvudsak är normativt orienterade och komponenter på landnivå fokuserar på kapacitetsutveckling, allt emedan det finns ett sampel mellan det globala och landspecifika arbetet. I fokus för verksamhet på landnivå är länder som präglas av ett demokratisk underskott, inklusive inskränkningar inom yttrandefrihet och brist på oberoende media. \n\nGlobalt normativt inom yttrandefrihet och medieutveckling bidrar CI-programmet i huvudsak till områdena säkerhet för journalister, yttrandefrihet online och offline, media literacy samt media och jämställdhet. På landnivå bidrar programmet till UNESCOs arbete med lokal radio i Afrika samt andra landspecifika yttrandefrihetsinsatser i Afrika, MENA och Latinamerika inom lagstifnings- och påverkansarbete samt kapacitetsbyggande insatser inom ICT, media och journalistik, vilket är ett viktigt bidrag till att stärka demokratisering och yttrandefrihet i dessa länder. CLT-programmet är starkt förankrat i 2005 års UNESCO konvention för kulturell mångfald som har yttrandefrihet och jämställdhet som grundläggande principer. Kapacitetsutveckling på landnivå fokuserar på förståelse av konventionen och metoder för datainsamlig och uppföljning av konventionen, vilket bl a  inkludrerar bevakning av yttrandefrihet/kommunikation. Det globala normativa arbetet fokuserar på att dokumentera och  formulera policys, standards och regleringar inom området. \n\nSverige kommer att stödja UNESCOs arbete för yttrandefrihet under en fyraårsperiod med 80,5 miljoner SEK, med en första utbetalning 2014, som är det första året för UNESCO med dess nya strategiska plan, program och budget. UNESCOs ansökan bygger på en programperiod om fyra år.

Detta belopp tilldelas utöver det belopp om 35 miljoner kronor i kärnstöd som redan har beslutats om för 2023 och de ytterligare 20 miljoner kronor som beslutades den 7 februari 2023 med anledning av jordbävningskatastrofen i Turkiet och Syrien."

            "Since the beginning of 2022, there has been a massive increase in the number of refugees, migrants, and returnees in transit by land northwards through Central America, compared to previous years. On 29 July 2022 the IFRC launched an Emergency Appeal.\nMigrants, returnees, and refugees are moving mostly through irregular channels. Many face bureaucratic barriers, suffer accidents and injuries, face extortion and sexual violence, or disappear and are separated from their families. Others are killed or die from disease or the harsh environmental conditions and weather. The majority of migrants and refugees in transit through Central America come from Cuba, Venezuela and Haiti. The situation is especially serious for the most vulnerable groups such as children and youth, women, indigenous populations, the elderly, disabled and LGBTIQ people. There is a particular concern for children; in 2022, out of every 100 migrants crossing the Darien Gap, one of the most dangerous migration routes in the world, 16 are minors.\nReasons for migrating include improving their income, escaping violence, reuniting with family members, recovering from the impact of recurring disasters and extreme weather events, and due to the devastating socioeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and continuing political crises.\nIt is estimated that up to 500,000 people have been affected considering the inflows and reports of irregular crossings from July to December 2021, representing a 45% increase scenario (most countries are above a 100% increase). The IFRC Emergency Appeal aims to reach 210,000 people regionally in all seven countries covered (Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Mexico) - 175,000 migrants in transit, 25,000 returnees and 10,000 people in host and origin communities.\nThe BRC Emergencies Team are continuing to monitor the situation. Due the low funding across the movement and low coverage of the emergency, BRC will be pledging £175,000 to the response."

Conducted as part of an annual interagency regional process led by UNHCR, this assessment supports the Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRP) for the Ukraine Situation. Covering topics such as protection, health, education, shelter, livelihoods, and food security, the survey offers critical data to inform evidence-based planning and prioritization, ensuring the specific needs of different refugee groups are addressed. Data collection was conducted through face-to-face interviews from May to July 2024 with a probability-based random sample of refugee households, managed collaboratively by UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration. Findings will guide strategic interventions and resource allocation to enhance the welfare and resilience of the refugee population in Estonia."

This project leverages advanced data analytics and innovative methodologies to enable CRAF’d ecosystem partners to anticipate and respond effectively to the escalating crisis of climate-induced displacement. By providing forecasts at a subnational level, CLIFDEW-GRID offers a more nuanced understanding of in-country heterogeneity compared to traditional country-level approaches. The system will be piloted in selected countries in Western and Eastern Africa.\n\nCLIFDEW-GRID functions as an early warning, grid-based modeling system designed to predict potential climate-induced forced displacement. It is a joint, innovative data project led by UNHCR and the University of California Irvine, with financial support from the Complex Risk Analytics Fund (CRAF’d)."

The activities are targeted, among other things at improving asylum space in the region, promoting tolerance to facilitate integration and advocating the country’s accession to the UN statelessness convention. The office also strives to develop durable solutions for forcibly displaced persons with a focus on education and employment.\n\nThis activity shows details of the UNHCR operation in Belarus for 2023 including the budget, funding, expenditure and results.",

            "At the end of 2021, Italy hosted over 165,000 refugees and asylum-seekers. This included over 12,000 unaccompanied children in reception facilities. Most persons of concern came from Nigeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Mali, Somalia and Gambia.\n\nIn Italy, UNHCR works with the government, sister UN agencies and non-governmental organizations to uphold the fundamental rights of people forced to flee and develop lasting solutions that ensure they can build better futures for themselves and their communities. UNHCR’s work in Italy focuses on protection and advocacy, including, among others, actions to promote adequate standards of reception and integration opportunities, ensure specific protection and support for children and persons with specific needs, and end statelessness.\n\nThis activity shows details of the UNHCR Italy Multi-country Office for 2023 including the budget, funding, expenditure and results. The Italy Regional Office coordinates activities in Cyprus, Italy and Malta and also covers the Holy See and San Marino.",

This project leverages advanced data analytics and innovative methodologies to enable CRAF’d ecosystem partners to anticipate and respond effectively to the escalating crisis of climate-induced displacement. By providing forecasts at a subnational level, CLIFDEW-GRID offers a more nuanced understanding of in-country heterogeneity compared to traditional country-level approaches. The system will be piloted in selected countries in Western and Eastern Africa.\n\nCLIFDEW-GRID functions as an early warning, grid-based modeling system designed to predict potential climate-induced forced displacement. It is a joint, innovative data project led by UNHCR and the University of California Irvine, with financial support from the Complex Risk Analytics Fund (CRAF’d)."

Technical support needed for this program component is included in Output 2.4. The technical and knowledge support needs of the national projects to generate socioeconomic benefits have been considered in the development of this coordination project and will be adapted as needed during project implementation to reflect the needs of projects.  Socioeconomic benefits will be monitored and reported on via the GWP program-level M&amp;E framework (see Annex L). Relevant program indicators include indicator 3.3.1.  Number of countries and/or communities with new and/or strengthened arrangements related to ownership, access, or use rights of Indigenous Peoples, and of local communities; and indicator 3.4.1.  Number of community members (sex disaggregated) economically benefiting from wildlife economy through i) new jobs created; ii) increased income; iii) new enterprises/business created or supported; and iv) other diversified livelihood opportunities.

            "To increase national and regional capacity and coordination among ASL stakeholders and partners for improved integrated landscape management and conservation in targeted areas in the Amazon.",
            "Note: Disbursement data provided is cumulative and covers disbursement made by the project Agency.",
            "The ASL3 Program’s environmental and social impacts overall are deemed to be positive, and negative environmental impacts are expected to be nil, or minimal, localized, and reversible. The Program will generate social benefits in critical aspects that influence well-being such as food security, health, and recovery of traditional knowledge, and at the same time, it will have an impact on better practices for conserving biodiversity and ecosystem resilience over generations. The Regional TA, focusing on knowledge management and cooperation, will not implement activities on the ground and as such very few environmental and social risks are associated with it. The main instruments of the Regional TA to guide its implementation, limiting risks are the Stakeholder Engagement Plan, the Gender plan and the associated Grievance Redress Mechanism, in which efforts to respect and promote Indigenous Peoples and other vulnerable communities as well as women and youth are described.  In regards to the ASL national projects, any E&amp;S risks will be mitigated through proper safeguard/standard instruments and procedures according to each GEF agency. The Program will facilitate, as needed, knowledge exchange and dialogue between projects in matters related to compliance with social and environmental safeguards and standards.Additional Summary on Risks:The risks to the implementation of the Regional TA and their mitigation strategy include:(i)         Increase in the number of countries participating in the ASL Program: Venezuela is joining the ASL, and thus all 8 sovereign countries of the Amazon will participate in the Program. Coordination and prioritization of activities with a larger number of stakeholders will be a new challenge. Continuous engagement with new members, and the previous experience from the addition of 4 more countries between ASL1 and ASL2, result in rating this as a low risk.(ii)       Differing needs from the national projects and readiness to initiate regional activities: While all the national projects are aligned to the ASL Theory of Change, there is heterogeneity in their activities, due to different contexts and priorities. In addition, as in ASL2, it is likely that not all 8 national projects will start at the same time and their implementation pace will also differ. Guyana for instance was included 6 months after the other national projects with an amended PFD and approved by GEF Council in December 2023. Negotiation processes between the executing and implementing agencies differ, resulting in different timelines. Those differences will mean that their needs related to the Regional TA may not coincide. The mitigation measures include the design and planning of regional activities so that they may start when enough projects are ready, or with a subgroup of countries that then expands, and that they adapt to respond to different stages of the projects.(iii)      Contrasting Government policies: The delivery of the knowledge exchange and coordination activities could be affected by different approaches to deforestation and other environmental and development issues in the countries. Experience from previous phases with different governments and political spectrums will facilitate managing the risk. In addition, the Belem Declaration and renewed efforts to strengthen ACTO have put regional coordination at the forefront of national agendas and the ASL will use its shared vision to lead countries toward common activities. Conflict over disputed areas between Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela could bring tension over cartographic data. Updated guidance and advice from the World Bank will mitigate the risk or at least inform the team on how to address related issues. The Regional TA will abide by the disclaimer, which states that the boundaries, colors, denominations, and any other information shown on maps prepared by the institution do not imply, on the part of the World Bank, any judgment on the legal status of any territory, or any endorsement or acceptance of such boundaries.Government changes: The ASL has seen many elections and other government changes since its inception in 2015 that affected its preparation and implementation, slowing the pace of implementation and delaying some activities at regional level that required decisions from national governments. Mitigation measures include working with technical staff, as well as with regional/state governors and municipalities, which will also generate longer term commitments, and offset risks from potential political changes at the national level. There is also a need to reach out and inform new national-level staff on the Program. An orientation package has been designed and submitted to all new members of the PSC to inform about the program. Engagement with other types of stakeholders such as the private sector, scientists, and international NGOs also ensures continuation of the Program by including different types of interests in the ASL Program. During implementation of ASL3, similar approaches will be used whenever changes in government staff take place."

            "Note: Disbursement data provided is cumulative and covers disbursement made by the project Agency.",
            "The Project will benefit the regular users and employees of public buildings of ministries, other central and local government institutions, and public facilities. They will include the citizens of the participating countries who rely on services provided by retrofitted public buildings, such as school children, users of hospitals or clinics and critical services that will benefit from enhanced security against power outages. Taxpayers will also benefit, indirectly from the lower electricity bills of public services funded taxes. Ministries and local government offices can use the cost savings from reduced energy consumption for other public services. Additional beneficiaries will include professionals and skilled workers in engineering, equipment suppliers, installation, and other service providers for EE, RE services from increased demand for their goods and services across the region.      Furthermore, this WB CEGEB Regional Project will enable regional integration and multiply the benefits of a coordinated sustained development and maintenance of capacity at the regional level whilst giving individual countries the ability to pursue national-level activities best suited to their circumstances. Women seeking technical jobs in the energy sector will benefit too from support activities included in the Project designed to reduce the relatively low level of female employment in the energy sector’s technical jobs.  Additional economic benefits will result from: (i) economies of scale in procurement and transaction costs, (ii) expansion of the regional market for EE and solar PV equipment; (iii) creation of local jobs for installation, operation, and maintenance services of EE and DPV systems and (iii) development of a regional public good by knowledge-sharing in activities such as procurement, operations and maintenance, and capacity-building.         The Project will support investments in EE and PV systems in public buildings in participating countries that will contribute to substantial GHG emission reductions, both through reduced energy demand from public customers but also from increased RE generation currently heavily dependent on fossil fuels. Installations of DPV plus battery storage systems for critical public facilities, and upgrades on the grid for integration of RE, will also bring adaptation benefits increasing resilience of energy supply against extreme climate conditions, such as hurricanes, by reducing their reliance on grid supply."

The activities are targeted, among other things at improving asylum space in the region, promoting tolerance to facilitate integration and advocating the country’s accession to the UN statelessness convention.

Most persons of concern came from Nigeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Mali, Somalia and Gambia.\n\nIn Italy, UNHCR works with the government, sister UN agencies and non-governmental organizations to uphold the fundamental rights of people forced to flee and develop lasting solutions that ensure they can build better futures for themselves and their communities. UNHCR’s work in Italy focuses on protection and advocacy, including, among others, actions to promote adequate standards of reception and integration opportunities, ensure specific protection and support for children and persons with specific needs, and end statelessness.\n\nThis activity shows details of the UNHCR Italy Multi-country Office for 2023 including the budget, funding, expenditure and results. The Italy Regional Office coordinates activities in Cyprus, Italy and Malta and also covers the Holy See and San Marino.",

As a result, an early warning was issued.\r\n\r\nIn line with the previously developed Early Action Protocol, most appropriate early actions are unconditional cash transfers. These shall mitigate the impacts of the imminend food insecurity of the targeted population. The transfers will be provided in 6 installments, the 1st distributions are expected to begin before the harvest (mid may) and end before the welding period when food insecurity is expected to peak.",

Early actions identified to mitigate the impending impact of drought on food security are unconditional cash transfers to the targeted population. These early emergency measures are fit to protect the food and nutrition security of the most vulnerable households. In order to keep families above the survival threshold and reduce the adoption of negative copying strategies, the uncodnidtional cash transfers will provide food aid and protection of goods to avoid further deterioration of livelihoods.\r\n\r\nThe approach will focus on using a shock-appropriate approach to increase capacity and synergize resources, ensure the integration of different activities in medium time to address the underlying vulnerabilities and risks, by mobilizing and raising awareness of communities (nutrition, hygiene-COVID) and effective coordination at different levels between institutions (local and central), communities and other actors with ongoing programs.",

            "The proposed project is focusing on two main pillars of immediate relief activities: WASH and Multipurpose Cash Transfer 1. WASH 1.1. Water Supply: the project will ensure sufficient supply of drinking water, as this has been stated as one of the priorities by the local crisis committee, including representative of the displaced families. To achieve this objective, WHH will deploy its water pumping and purification system from Goma and run it for at least 4 weeks. The system will be installed at the nearby river and provide 45m³-60m³ of water per day and will be running within 14 days. Considering the daily need at this stage at 10ltr (average, according to SPHERE standard) per person/day, the system can supply water for 4.500 - 6.000 people per day. Further, the project will repair two water catchments sites with 15 water points in total (to be repaired within 1 week), and additional 11 emergency water points with water purification will be established at places not connected to the public system and too far from the river. With these 3 layers of water supply, we aim to cover the immediate needs of the displaced population and host communities in need for 1 month. 1.2. Sanitation facilities The project aims to install emergency latrines and/or extend existing latrines and sanitation facilities in the public spaces where people are seeking shelter. 15 sites will be identified in close cooperation with the local crisis committee. Installation will be supported with workforce by people living on the compounds. The emergency latrines & handwashing stands will bring first relief and an improvement of the sanitation situation for 1,000 HH. 2 WASH Experts will be transferred from WHH Bunia to Nobili to implement the WASH component. These experts will be supported by locals, hired by WHH to support the response. 2. Multipurpose Cash Transfer WHH will use its experience in unconditional cash transfers to provide one time distribution of 35 USD per HH for up to 6.300 registered IDP households in Nobili town. Markets show full functionality and supplies can be purchased from Uganda. The multipurpose cash transfer has been decided, as the displaced families have different priorities and mainly lack the purchasing power to buy goods of their choice in the market. With the slightly reduced amount of 35 USD it is possible to reach all 6.300 displaced families. WHH will contract a local financial service provider, potentially a bank already contracted for another project, to distribute the cash to the beneficiaries. Market Monitoring (availability and prices) and a Post-Distribution Monitoring is planned. 1 Cash-Expert will be transferred from WHH Beni to Nobili to oversee the distribution. Community Mobiliser will support the registration and distribution. In summary, the planned activities will cover water supply for for 1 month, improve sanitation/hygiene situation for 1,000 HH and distribute 35 USD/household for 6.300 Households.",
            "The project targets IDPs which are living with host families or in public spaces, such as schools, churches and market places. The total number of direct beneficiaries: 6300 Households * 6 (average HH size) = 37.800 beneficiaries. The total number of people benefiting from the different layers of the emergency water supply activities will be clearer."

Many of the impacted households, particularly economically vulnerable households, are already deprived of basic foods due to lack of accessibility and availability.

The intervention will enable the target households to recover within an convenient period of time so that they can regain their capacity and return to their normal lives. At the end of the operation, the results to be achieved are as follows: R1: Improvement of the beneficiaries' access to basic food R2: Reduction of the risk of contamination of water-related illnesses R3: Contribution to the improvement of the rebound capacity of affected and vulnerable communities Activities for each result: R1: A1: Selection of beneficiaries according to pre-established targeting criteria A2: To carry out an unconditional cash distribution for the benefit of the vulnerable while taking into account in advance the conditions of availability and accessibility of food products at the local level. A3: Creation of a temporary work opportunity through cash for work by prioritizing the sectors of intervention beforehand. R2: A1: Distribution of WASH kits to beneficiaries in a timely manner including water treatment products. A2: Identify the main sources of safe and accessible drinking water for the community for sanitation purposes A3: Sanitation of water sources through cash for work A4: Strengthen the dissemination of educational messages and continuous awareness raising for the actions to be taken in case of flooding, particularly in the field of WASH.

            "WHH will target vulnerable households: - Households dependent on a daily income resource - Households deprived of their usual income resource - Households with low or insignificant food stocks - Households with problems of access to basic food for a fairly long period of time due to the lack of availability of labour as a main source of income. - Households affected by and affected by the flooding - Households that take longer to bounce back from the shock. The calculation of the number of beneficiaries is based on the results of studies on the Household Economy Analyses carried out in the area of this investment zone in 2018. At the end of this study, the proportion of socio-economic classes is distributed as follows: - The category of very poor covers 25% of the households in the zone. - The poor class category covers 38% of the households in the area. - The middle class category covers 23% of the households in the area. - The category for the wealthy class covers 14% of households in the area. As mentioned in the previous explanation, the beneficiaries of the project will be the economically vulnerable categories of households including the very poor and poor classes. For the target areas, the response will be focused on the six most impacted communes in Amparafaravola district. This gives us a total number of 1116 households i.e. 5580 persons with an average size of 5 persons per household."

People neither have access to safe drinking water nor clean water for personal hygiene and cooking. Spread of water-borne diseases like typhoid fever is of very high risk. There is low use of household water treatment. The food sold in their areas is likely to contain typhoid bacteria. Sewage leaks occur and may be contaminating boreholes, Solid waste is not being collected and has formed dumps in open spaces. Typhoid in high density suburbs likely to spread further to other areas. Provision of NFI, namely soap and aqua tabs for three months arc the prinrary need. Furthermore, sensitizing and awareness rising of the population together with hygiene training is essential at this point; this includes mobilization, orientation and training of community health volunteers for response as well as provision of IEC material.",

            "Tajikistan is prone to natural disasters, e.g. floods, earthquakes, landslides, mudflows, avalanches, droughts, and heavy snowfalls. Its mountainous terrain, coupled with the specific geological and hydrological conditions, translates into a high degrees of vulnerability towards climate change. At the same time, Tajikistan‘s deteriorating infrastructure has increased the population‘s vulnerability to extreme weather events and seismic risks. With most assets, including irrigation channels, river embankments, roads, bridges, and dams, built in the Soviet era, infrastructure maintenance remains weak due to limited financial resources and lack of knowledge by the government. Existing mudflow drainage systems along the villages are destroyed or slatted over the years, which when rapidly filled increase the risk of human casualties and physical damages. The costs of foreseen mudflows can be assessed much higher than for social and physical preparedness measures. With clear evidence of increased risk, combined with existing vulnerabilities in the most remote regions of Tajikistan, the Start Network voted in support of activating the Fund in anticipation of flooding and landslides.",
            "- The negative impact of currently forecasted flooding/mudflows for the local population (human tools/destroyed infrastructure) will substantially be decreased and the resilience of the population towards disasters will be strengthened in the longer term. - The strengthened capacities of the local authorities and the better interaction between the local authorities and the local population will reduce the economic and human loss in the long term and can be copied to other areas at risk in the Zerafshan valley.",
            "The pre-selected villages have been chosen upon strong request from the zonal CoES as there already smaller mudflows appeared. In total, the project will cover app. 2000 households with nearly 10.000 people. The whole community in the pre-selected high risk villages will benefit through the envisaged project activities like protecting infrastructure, capacity building including drills/simulation exercises, maintenance of EWSs etc. The beneficiaries are calculated on the basis of number of households with five members."

The main objectives are to strengthen preparedness capacities through training, SOPs, financing mechanisms, and improved coordination; validate and update the Anticipatory Action Plan (AAP) with clear triggers such as rainfall anomalies, river levels, and food price changes; pre-position resources and partnerships with suppliers, communities, and authorities; and enhance community readiness through knowledge, communication tools, and tailored preparedness plans.The project will begin by updating and finalizing the AAP with local stakeholders to ensure its relevance. Activation activities will then address critical needs in water access, livestock health, and agricultural sustainability. At least two high-yield boreholes will be drilled or rehabilitated and fitted with solar technology, supported by water point committees, pump minder training, and conservation awareness. To protect livelihoods, 3,000 beneficiaries (750 households) will receive supplementary feed and veterinary services, alongside training in sustainable livestock management. For food security, the project will support 100 households in poultry and gardens, and provide small grain seed to 250 households, coupled with training in climate-smart agriculture. These actions will diversify incomes, sustain food production, and strengthen resilience."

Developed plans will monitor available forecast and risk information, pre-agree thresholds for taking action, establish processes based on these thresholds for raising timely alerts, and identify, with communities, appropriate anticipatory actions. During the same consultative meetings, we will find out why some of the districts and their extension staff don't disseminate information to the persons usually affected so that  context specific means of dissemination are included in the plan."

            "The goal of the Development of Triple Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (DeTACT) project is to provide a solution using currently available antimalarials to contain multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria in the Greater Mekong Sub region, and to prevent the spread or emergence of resistance in India, Africa, and beyond. DeTACT aims to provide evidence from clinical, market and community-based research in support of a global change in policy to allow large-scale deployment of triple artemisinin-based combination therapies (TACTs) for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Switching from artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to TACTs could be one of the last available options using currently available drugs to treat multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria and prevent or delay it from spreading or emerging in areas where it is not yet present. The project is divided into seven work packages: (1) Develop two co-packaged TACTs for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. (2) Using these products, conduct randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trials in 13 sites in 8 African countries and 4 Asian countries to provide evidence of safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the TACTs. (3) Mathematical modelling to assess the potential of TACTs to delay the emergence and further spread of antimalarial drug resistance and the costs and benefits of introducing TACTs in countries with different levels of drug resistance, malaria transmission rates, and adherence to treatment guidelines. (4) Analyse the conceptual ethical aspects and conduct an empirical ethics/social science study addressing the ethical aspects of a change to TACTs in the African paediatric patient population.  (5) A market positioning assessment based on interviews and focus group discussions with stakeholders ranging from end users to national and regional policy makers, to address the barriers and strategies to overcome these, and acceptability of changing to TACTs in Asia and Africa, which present different epidemiological settings. (6) Effective communication of the design of the study and evidence generated in order to engage with key stakeholders at an early stage.(7) Conduct a meta-analysis on harmonised individual patient-level data to compare the efficacy, safety, tolerability of TACTs versus ACTs in the general study population and in sub-groups (e.g., malnourished or undernourished children)."

Antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacterial infections are increasingly predicted  to have catastrophic impact on global health and wellbeing. To better respond to this growing crisis, we need the highest quality insight into how, where and when AMR emerges and the ability  to monitor its progression so that we can understand whether our mitigation efforts are effective at a local, national and international level. \rWe have previously implemented capacity for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) at key  reference sites, embedded in nascent or existing national surveillance networks in Nigeria, India,  Colombia and The Philippines and shown the potential to enhance surveillance through outbreak  detection and monitoring of resistant populations. Saving lives demands rapid delivery of the right  data to the right decision makers. Transforming the data landscape to operationalise the use of  intelligent surveillance is key to moving from public health research to public health  implementation. Here we will: \r- Deliver a data and reporting landscape for WGS-enhanced surveillance. - Leapfrog a surveillance network in Nigeria to spot and stop outbreaks \r- Deliver stakeholder specific reporting pathways in The Philippines \r- Monitor the impact of interventions in India \r- Bring together surveillance for OneHealth in Colombia \r- Share and implement the above across Countries \r- Develop regional centres of excellence to drive international policy. \rWe will leave a legacy of engineering, data science and data driven surveillance enhanced through  the intelligent use of WGS.

This leadership network will be informed by research on both barrier-crossing leadership and an understanding of the likelihood these fragile states will descend into conflict. Training on FoRB issues will be delivered so that FoRB leaders (parliamentarians and belief leaders) can propose initiatives for their national or regional context and then providing them with the technical assistance and expertise to deliver such solutions. Best practice will be shared both within and across the regions. The regions / countries are; West Africa: The Gambia, Ghana and Sierra Leone. East Africa: Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda. South Asia: Bangladesh and Pakistan. This activity covers the publishing of a barriers-crossing leadership study, the publishing of historical and contemporary volatility indices, submission of a paper and an edited volume on the recent history of FoRB in the 8 fragile states and the management and support of the operational delivery by the main collaborator, the Church of England."

            "Aim(s) of the research Our aim is to improve quality-of-life for hip fracture patients and to reduce healthcare costs in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC) in Asia. Background to the research Older patients are particularly likely to break a bone (fracture) because of a fall from a standing height, as their bones are weakened by osteoporosis. These fragility fractures have serious consequences; in the UK 25% of hip fracture patients die within a year and survivors have a reduction in their quality-of-life similar to having a stroke. Outcomes may be even worse in LMIC without the same level of healthcare resource. Asia is particularly affected by rapidly ageing populations. The number of hip fractures is expected to increase from 1,124,060 now to 2,563,488 in 2050. Associated healthcare cost may rise to US$15 billion. Improving care for patients with hip fracture is therefore a priority in this region. Looking after patients following a hip fracture requires healthcare workers from many different backgrounds to work together. These include surgeons, doctors specialising in looking after older patients, nurses and therapists, each with defined roles and responsibilities. In the UK, this team approach has reduced the number of patients dying and improved quality-of-life after hip fracture. It also reduced time spent in hospital and associated healthcare costs . This study is about testing the benefits of such multidisciplinary care in LMIC in Asia. Design and methods The project will have two parts: 1. To refine the multidisciplinary HIPCARE training and support package for each LMIC. 2. To see if the HIPCARE intervention improves the quality-of-life for hip fracture patients in LMIC and whether it reduces healthcare costs, compared with usual care. The HIPCARE training package has three main components: early surgery to fix the hip fracture, early assessment by a medical doctor and early walking with the help of a therapist to speed recovery. Having refined the training materials to make HIPCARE specific to each country, we will do a large study to compare HIPCARE with usual care in 40 hospitals in LMIC. Community engagement This proposal has been developed together with members of the Global Health Fragility Fractures Community Engagement and Involvement Panel with support from the World Musculoskeletal Trauma Patient and Public Involvement Group. The views of patients and their carers, from Asia and the UK, informed all aspects of the study but in particular the choice of eligibility criteria, primary outcome measure and follow-up plan. Dissemination We disseminate the findings of this study: 1. Through plain language summaries specific to each country via social media/web-pages as well as hard-copy 2. Through our partnership with the Global Fragility Fracture Network, with its many events worldwide 3. Through scientific publications and presentations"

            "Outline:A UK and low-and middle-income country (LMIC) research partnership that aims to develop and evaluate a community pharmacy-based intervention to improve hypertension management among low-income urban residents in Bangladesh and Pakistan. By delivering hypertension care through community pharmacies, the team seeks to enhance access to care and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases(CVDs). CVDs are the leading cause of death globally, and hypertension is The most significant modifiable risk factor for CVDs. In Bangladesh And Pakistan, a high percentage of individuals with hypertension remain undiagnosed, untreated, or have uncontrolled blood pressure, particularly among low-income urban residents who face significant barriers to accessing healthcare. Community pharmacies are widely accessible and frequently used by these populations but are not fully integrated into formal healthcare systems. The long-term aim of the award is to reduce premature deaths and disabilities caused by hypertension and associated CVDs in Bangladesh and Pakistan. This intervention will enable community Pharmacists to provide hypertension care, including blood pressure monitoring, medication adherence support, health education, and referrals to primary care physicians. Commencing in March 2025, the award will map existing community pharmacies and engage with key stakeholders to understand the current practices and identify barriers and facilitators regarding the implementation of the intervention. The intervention will be tested via a feasibility study before undertaking a randomised control trial to assess the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the intervention in reducing systolic blood pressure.The award has nine objectives: 1. Develop a context-specific intervention aimed at managing hypertension among low-income urban residents in Bangladesh and Pakistan through community pharmacies. 2. Explore the feasibility of delivering the intervention and refine methods and procedures for a large-scale trial. 3.Assesstheeffectivenessof the intervention in reducing systolic bloodpressureamonglow-incomeurbanresidentsaged30years and older with hypertension in Bangladesh and Pakistan. 4.Conductacomprehensiveprocessevaluationtounderstandthe implementation process of the intervention and how the health system and urban context in each site influence its effectiveness and sustainability. 5.Developacost-effectivenessmodel for hypertension care and assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention, including the costs of scaling up and the value of investing in strategies to improve uptake. 6.

            "Dengue and other viruses transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti are a growing problem in West Africa with increasingly frequent outbreaks. Control of the mosquito is the most effective way to protect humans. This project, which will run from 2024 to 2028 is based in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso where regular dengue epidemics have occurred in recent years. To carry out the research project, we have formed a collaboration between Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM, UK), Université Joseph Ki-Zerbo (Burkina Faso) Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Santé – Direction Régionale de l'Ouest (Burkina Faso), Spanish National Research Council (Spain), Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (France), University of Glasgow (UK) and King's College London (UK). We propose to develop a community-based approach for arbovirus outbreak prevention and response. We will collect data on the abundance and distribution of Aedes aegypti in different environments, their genetics and behaviour, human exposure to bites and circulating virus levels to model the forces governing dengue dynamics and develop an improved index for virus transmission risk. Additional work will test the effectiveness of digital surveillance of mosquitoes using a mobile app to determine a potential role for citizen science. Trials will be conducted of different tools to control mosquito adults and immatures, including a large-scale community-embedded programme to determine the effectiveness of reducing mosquito breeding sources. Capacity building is embedded throughout, with the aim of developing skills in trial design and analysis, social science, community-based programme development and implementation, genetic diagnostics and genomics, serosurveillance, entomology and statistics/modelling. Community engagement and involvement activities will play a crucial role throughout the project activities and have a dedicated work package supported by researchers based both in Burkina Faso and in northern partner institutes. We believe that new evidence on arbovirus epidemiology in sub-Saharan Africa and a new generation of local specialists is urgently needed to fill the skills gaps from the bottom upwards and to equip African health systems with the experience, knowledge, and motivation to respond effectively to arbovirus outbreaks.",
            "1. Development of improved indices for estimating arbovirus transmission risk by integrated modelling of adult Aedes aegypti abundance, distribution and behaviour, genomic admixture, environmental covariables, human behaviour, immunological biomarkers and mosquito biting patterns2. Implementation of community-based surveillance for immature mosquito development sites, adult occurrence and biting perceptions using the Mosquito Alert mobile app, cross-validated via entomological monitoring of adults and larval sites and bite biomarkers3. Community-embedded implementation of interventions including (i) a large-scale cluster randomised control trial of larval source management, and (ii) a stepwise-phased suite of adult-targeted interventions, suited to local Ae. aegypti bionomics, leading to a household-level randomised control trial of the most promising4. Capacity development of researchers from Burkina Faso extended to West Africa via PhD topics embedded within all project activities and outreach activities to the wider West African research and vector control community5. Exploration of the interactions between human behaviour and mosquito biology, and via empowerment of citizens with mosquito control knowledge and practice, enabling successful implementation of activities."

            "Evaluation and Transfer of mobile whole slide tissue scanners and liquid\rbiopsies to deliver fast and precise diagnosis for improved outcomes of children and young adults with EBV-driven lymphoma: a joint Tanzanian and Ugandan\rPaediatric Oncology Network Initiative",
            "Summary:\r\rSub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is facing a major public health challenge from non-communicable diseases. The\rdisease burden attributable to cancer is rapidly rising, with a predicted 85% increase in incidence by\r2030. In a region where 40% of the entire population is under the age of 15, cancer is more likely to\rpresent in younger patients in sub-Saharan Africa, evidenced by a rising paediatric/adolescent\rincidence.\r\rAggressive lymphoma accounts for nearly 10% of all cancer diagnosis in the region, due to a strong\rassociation with Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection(5,7,8). Despite established diagnostic pathways,\rtreatments and improving outcomes in developed countries, diagnostics, treatment and support are\rseverely limited in SSA and outcomes poor(2,9,10). Tissue diagnosis in particular poses a significant challenge with a single pathologist being responsible for millions of patients within a region(9).\r\rFurthermore, there are significant practical challenges to obtaining tumour tissue from children.\rWith the availability of digital pathology and low-cost peripheral blood DNA analysis, we now have\rthe potential to rapidly and accurately screen, diagnose and monitor children and young adults with\rEBV associated lymphoma (EBVL) without the specific need for tissue biopsy. We already have\rpreliminary results from our laboratory demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity of this method\rfor lymphoma diagnosis(11).\r\rThis liquid biopsy only requires an additional 4-10ml (1-3 teaspoons) of peripheral venous blood collected\rinto a specified blood tube. Given that all patients currently have standard of care (SOC) testing, including\rroutine blood tests and often an insertion of a long-term venous access line, this additional sample poses\rminimal if any risk to the patient.\r\rOur proposal also aims to address issues surrounding pathological diagnosis. Currently in East Africa,\ra single pathologist is responsible for 3.2m patients. Thus, despite tissue biopsy remaining as the gold\rstandard diagnostic test, a major hurdle to diagnosis is obtaining a result in a timely manner. Samples\rare often transported overseas for reporting in large established tertiary labs.\r\rWe will therefore assess the utility of a digital microscopy platform which we are already using for teaching\rand training in the region. This technology will enable local scientists of obtain diagnostic quality digital\rimages of traditional histopathology glass slides that can be shared immediately for reporting.\rIn collaboration with our partners across SSA, we will assess the accuracy of these two low cost novel\rtechnologies for diagnosing EBVL in East African patients aged 5 to 21 suspected of having the condition.\rTechnology 1: Liquid biopsy – detection of fragments of lymphoma specific DNA shed into the peripheral\rblood from tumours. Also known as circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA). Testing requires collection of 10ml\r(2 teaspoons) or peripheral blood. We already have pilot data in an Oxford cohort of lymphoma patients\rthat demonstrates a high sensitivity and specificity for ctDNA as a diagnostic tool.\r\rTechnology 2: Mobile digital microscopy – device that can reproduce high-resolution, diagnostic\rquality, whole slide digital images from blood smears and tissue biopsy slides.\rAim: to improve diagnosis of childhood lymphoma in sub-Saharan Africa by making it faster and more\rprecise using mobile digital pathology devices and liquid biopsy\r\rObjectives\r1. Assess the diagnostic accuracy of liquid biopsy testing\r2. Asses the diagnostic accuracy of digital pathology\r3. Development of a digital pathology machine learning algorithm\r4. Transfer of above novel tests and associated expertise to local laboratories\rPatients Children and adolescents aged 3 to 30 suspected of having EBVL.\r\rDesign\rRetrospective Case control study.\r\rMethod\rAll patients recruited will continue to have routine local standard of care testing.\rWe will compare the two technologies against current local ‘gold standard’ tests for diagnosing EBVL.\r- Gold Standard tissue glass slide light-microscopy versus liquid biopsy (single blood test, 4-10ml at study\rentry)\r- Gold Standard tissue glass slide light-microscopy versus whole slide digital images (WSI)\rThe results of the novel tests will be analysed retrospectively, therefore therapeutic decisions will only be\rmade based upon the gold standard test results.\r\rProvided we observe a strong correlation between WSI, ctDNA and the gold standard test, we will plan to\rproceed to a second study where we will assess the time-to-diagnosis for these three methods."

            "Vaccination is a hugely important public health intervention: key to smallpox eradication, polio\r\nelimination, and control of Ebola outbreaks and the COVID-19 pandemic. But not everyone benefits\r\nequally. Some vaccines give weaker protection in people from rural, tropical settings than in those from high income settings: for example, BCG for tuberculosis and oral polio vaccine for polio. Some new vaccines, under development, also elicit weaker responses in people living in low-income, rural\r\nsettings. The biological reasons for this are not fully understood. Also, some people benefit less from\r\nvaccines for socioeconomic reasons, such as the social context of the communities they live in,\r\nincluding limited access to accurate information to aid vaccine choices. Social and biological factors\r\ncan interact to make communities “vulnerable” in terms of vaccine impact. For example, poor people in rural communities with difficulties in vaccine access may also be undernourished or exposed to\r\ninfections that alter immune responses to vaccination. This needs to be addressed to promote health\r\nequity, but also to secure maximum global benefit from vaccines: non-immune communities are foci for recurrent disease outbreaks.\r\n\r\nVAnguard’s goal is to understand how biological and social factors interact to impair vaccine impact in\r\nvulnerable African communities, in order to develop integrated strategies to optimise vaccine benefits\r\nand drive health equity.\r\n\r\nVAnguard will bring together African and UK experts in vaccine research, implementation and\r\nstakeholder and community engagement, to work in Uganda and Kenya to\r\n\r\n1. Investigate how biological factors (such as infections, nutrition) influence vaccine responses\r\n2. Explore how communities perceive and access vaccines, what influences them to take up\r\nvaccines for themselves and their families, and how this relates to social vulnerability, biological health status and vaccine information\r\n3. Bring together biological and social data, and engage communities, to work out how\r\nvaccination can best be optimised for vulnerable communities, thereby also benefitting entire\r\npopulations.\r\n\r\nFirst, we shall work with national stakeholders (such as Ministries of Health, and vaccine-related nongovernmental organisations), review literature, and work on samples from previous studies, to identify Ugandan and Kenyan communities likely to have most difficulty in getting the best out of vaccination programmes (“vulnerable communities”). Then, with stakeholders and communities, we shall co-design the VAnguard Community Study, and implement it to investigate in detail which biological and social factors most influence vaccine impact in vulnerable communities. Data and economic modellers will study the results to identify which factors could usefully be modified, and we shall work with the communities to explore ways in which this could be done. Hence we shall co-develop strategies which national stakeholders may be able to implement straight away, or which can be tested in future studies.\r\n\r\nThe work will be led by young African scientists, supported by local and international experts, to build\r\ncapacity for African vaccine research. Biological, social, and implementation scientists and experts will work closely together to understand each other’s disciplines, establishing a culture of collaboration that will foster sustainable pathways to the desired impact: healthy communities."

This is a grant to the University of Oxford, working in collaboration with the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, to strengthen the evidence base on the current global burden of AMR, and help us to understand how, where and why it is changing. The Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance (GRAM) Project is providing the essential health intelligence to help drive awareness, support better surveillance, and prompt policy action to control AMR, including facilitating antimicrobial stewardship. The Fleming Fund grant specifically supports the collection and synthesis of data on the burden of disease associated with AMR in LMICs and is working to ensure that AMR is included within the Global Burden of Disease study. This project was not put out to an open, competitive tender process because IHME is the only organisation in the world with the computing power required for AMR geospatial mapping, which means they are the only institution capable of mapping the global burden of AMR into the global burden of disease. IHME is also the only institution currently mapping the global burden of disease, though the resulting information is open source access. IHME has chosen the University of Oxford as a supplier of data and is under no obligation to grant access to their computing power to another organisation."

            "The Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) programme has made substantial progress in understanding the African climate and has developed methodologies to evaluate the regional climate processes and impact-relevant indices which matter locally. As part of the FCFA Accountable Grant funded by the UK Government's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), previously referred to as the Department for International Development (DfID) (IATI identifier GB-1-203835-107), the LaunchPAD project was initiated as one of the three key outputs to continue the legacy of the broader FCFA programme (IATI identifier GB-1-203835-102). The LaunchPAD is the first phase of the Climate Model Evaluation Hub for Africa and has been established to build upon the novel science findings and methods to extend the work to more regions and systems, and to embed tools into automated software that will fast-track the understanding of how well climate models simulate climate dynamics in African regions. The establishment of the Hub was made possible by building on existing FCFA research networks through researchers at the University of Oxford, University of Yaounde I, University of Nairobi, University of Cape Town, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, and the Met Office, showcasing the strong legacy and importance of FCFA partnerships between British and African research institutions.",
            "SouthSouthNorth, as the holder of the Accountable Grant, oversees the management the LaunchPAD. Oxford University is the lead implementing partner, contracting individuals from other institutions to work on the project. Due to the qualitative nature of this activity, all reporting is done through the submission of quarterly reports, rather than using IATI's quantitative submissions. This activity is referred to under Output 1 in the reporting."

            "Fever is one of the most common symptoms leading to health care seeking and hospital admission in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Until recently, most febrile illness in these regions has been attributed to malaria; however, with scale-up of point-of-care testing for malaria following the 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation to test before treating it has become clear that most febrile patients do not have malaria. Patients with confirmed cases of ‘non-malarial fever’ are more likely to receive antimicrobial medicines, although not all cases require or respond to available antimicrobials. This could drive antimicrobial resistance, whilst having little impact on individual or population health. The ability to differentiate between infections that do and don’t require antimicrobial treatment could greatly benefit public health. We have been funded for four years by the UK Department for International Development (DfID) to conduct a study called “Febrile Illness Evaluation in a Broad Range of Endemicities (FIEBRE)”. The FIEBRE study is led by researchers at LSHTM and our collaborators including partners at four sites in Africa (Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe) and Asia (Laos)."

            "Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases to affect humankind. It kills around half a million people, mostly young children in Africa. It also places a huge disease burden on large parts of the world, leading to hundreds of millions of serious infections. As well as directly causing suffering and death, this limits the development of large parts of the globe, reducing productivity and maintaining inequality.  Malaria is caused by a tiny, single celled parasite, known as Plasmodium. An individual contracts malaria when bitten by an infected mosquito. The parasites are injected into the blood stream as the mosquito feeds. These first develop and divide within the liver without causing disease. They next emerge from the liver and infect red blood cells, replicating and increasing in number and driving the symptoms of malaria. At the same time, a fraction of the parasites within the blood take a different developmental route, adopting a form known as the gametocytes. When a mosquito takes a blood meal from an infected person, they are likely to ingest some of these gametocytes. Within the midgut of the mosquito these develop into male and female gametes, and fuse together. This completes the infection cycle and the parasites move to the salivary glands of the mosquito, ready to be injected into another human victim.  Development of a vaccine to prevent malaria has proved very challenging and it is likely that the vaccines of the future will simultaneously target multiple stages of the parasite life cycle, blocking both liver and blood cell entry. One component of such a vaccine is likely to target the gametes of the parasite and to stop them from fusing. This is known as a transmission-blocking vaccine component as it will prevent the development of the parasite within the mosquito and will therefore stop the disease from being passed from person to person through the action of this blood-sucking insect.   We study a molecule called Pfs48/45 that is found on the surface of the gametocytes and gametes of Plasmodium parasites. Pfs48/45 is essential for a male gamete to fuse with a female gamete and if the immune system of an animal is exposed to Pfs48/45, it produces molecules called antibodies that bind to Pfs48/45 and prevent gametes from fusing. This means that if we can include Pfs48/45 in a vaccine, it will trigger the human body to make antibodies that will prevent malaria from being transmitted to other people. This will reduce the prevalence of malaria in the community and will help to eradicate the disease.  Despite this promise, Pfs48/45 is a challenging molecule to produce in a functional form and in large quantities. In addition, if we are to make vaccines that simultaneously contain multiple components, it will be important for each component to be as small and focused as possible, to make it easier and cheaper for them to be produced and distributed. For this reason we aim to understand the structure and shape of Pfs48/45 and also to understand the location and the nature of the sites where the gamete-fusion-preventing antibodies bind. This information will allow us to use the latest computational tools to design novel molecules which contain just the regions of Pfs48/45 that are needed to bind to inhibitory antibodies.  We will then inject mice with these novel immunogens and study the antibodies that are produced in a mosquito-infection experiment. If mosquitoes are fed on human blood containing malaria parasites, gametes can fuse, leading to the formation of cysts in the gut wall of the mosquito. If gamete fusion is prevented, the cysts are no longer formed. We will therefore study the ability of the antibodies induced by our novel immunogens to prevent cyst formation revealing which of our designs is most effective at blocking gamete fusion and preventing transmission of the malaria parasite. These newly designed molecules will form part of the malaria vaccines of the future.",

            "Between 2000 and 2010, worldwide antibiotic consumption increased by 35%, including large rises in the use of antibiotic drugs used as a last-resort, when other treatments fail. This rise was particularly apparent in middle income countries, with growing populations and increasing access to antibiotics. Rising levels of antibiotic consumption are associated high levels of antibiotic resistance, and increasing numbers of bacterial infections that are difficult or impossible to treat with antibiotics. Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use has been shown to reduce the level of antibiotic resistance at population-level in high income countries, but few population-level interventions aiming to reduce antibiotic use have been evaluated in low and middle income countries with higher burdens of infectious disease and antibiotic resistance.  This development grant will inform the design of two community-based interventions aiming to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use and related antibiotic resistance. One intervention will target the supply of antibiotics through private pharmacies, the major source of treatment for minor illness, and where antibiotics can easily be obtained without a prescription. Introducing a rapid diagnostic test in this setting would help pharmacists to differentiate between people with non-bacterial infections that do not require antibiotics, and those with likely bacterial infections that should be referred to a health professional. The other intervention will tackle the demand for antibiotics in communities by using participatory discussion in groups to improve understanding of the problem of antibiotic resistance, and develop appropriate strategies to address it in their community.   To assist intervention development, we will conduct a review of the literature to learn from other successful approaches using rapid diagnostic tests outside the formal healthcare system, and health behaviour change interventions in communities. We will collect information from providers and consumers of antibiotics in communities, to understand what drives inappropriate use, and we will also explore their views about the introduction of rapid diagnostic tests in pharmacies, and what price would be attractive for both. We will work with community members, using visual media to develop materials and messages that can be used to talk about antibiotic resistance with other communities.  On finalising the design of the interventions, a methodology will be developed to evaluate and understand the effect of these interventions, with input from experts and local partners. Funding sources will be identified to implement the interventions and research the effect of community-based interventions on antibiotic use and resistance in rural Vietnam. We will disseminate our learning from this process through international peer reviewed publications, briefing papers, and discussions with local partners and community participants.",

            "Air pollution is an important cause of ill-health worldwide. This is particularly the case in China and many other developing countries, in which outdoor air pollution is worsening due to increased traffic and industrial activities. Furthermore, many people still use solid fuels (e.g. wood, charcoal or coal) for cooking and heating in rural areas, generating harmful smoke and other toxic substances inside the home. Although we know that air pollution causes death and illness at the population level, the exact extent is not fully understood because accurate information is lacking. Reliable estimation of the disease risks arising from air pollution requires measurements of individual exposures to air pollution and their subsequent disease outcomes (i.e. onset of new diseases and death). We propose to address this knowledge gap using the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB), a large study of 500,000 men and women recruited from 10 diverse urban and rural areas in China in 2004-08 with detailed tracking of disease outcomes as a resource to study the health effects of air pollution. This represents an efficient approach that avoids the need to generate a separate expensive study to conduct this work.   Use of CKB in this way requires improvements to existing air pollution data. As in many other large scale epidemiological studies, CKB did not directly measure actual air pollution levels individually, but relied on participants to report information on the type of fuel they use for cooking or heating and how often, or how close to a main road they live. Since individuals spend a varying amount of time in different locations doing various activities, this may be inaccurate measure of individual air pollution. The ideal would be to measure in real time the pollutant concentrations in the air breathed by each person individually. However, this will be impractical in a study of 0.5 million participants, so the challenge is to achieve estimates of exposure in a cost-effective manner. This proposal represents a pilot project to test and assess different methods of measuring individual exposure to household and ambient air pollution.  In this project we will ask 300 CKB participants from 2 rural and 1 urban regions to carry a small wearable monitor with them to record particle pollutant concentration for two 5 day periods in both warm and cool seasons of the year. In addition, we will ask them to note what activity (e.g. cooking, commuting) they are doing, the duration and the location, so that we can understand how much of their pollution exposure comes from indoor or outdoor environments. Because it could be difficult and expensive to ask each participant to wear a monitor, we will also test whether it is sufficient to estimate individual air pollution by using data from ground monitoring networks, supplemented by satellite remote sensing technology. Two of the many satellites orbiting Earth carry sensors that detect infrared light transmitted through the atmosphere, providing a measure of airborne particulate matter. Using information from satellites and ground monitors, we will create a more complete map of air pollution. We will test and optimise this new approach in Suzhou, an urban CKB site that already has good coverage of ground-based pollution monitoring data. Based on the residential addresses of study participants, we can use this air pollution map to estimate an individual's ambient exposure level. We will use this information to carry out an analysis to investigate the health effects of air pollution in Suzhou participants.   This proposal will provide important new understanding and experience needed to plan a larger project involving all 0.5 million participants in CKB. Ultimately we aim to collect reliable exposure and disease outcome data to accurately understand the impact of air pollution on health in China.",

            "Injuries are a leading cause of death among children around the world. Globally, nearly 650,000 children under the age of 15 lose their lives every year to injuries and violence. This burden is unequally distributed between low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) and high-income countries (HIC) with the mortality rate from unintentional injuries in LMICs being nearly double that of HICs. In particular, Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest proportion of under 5 deaths in the world.  More than 70% of these injuries are non-transport unintentional or \"accidental\" injuries. Evidence shows that a large proportion of childhood unintentional injuries take place in and around the home, where children are generally believed to be well supervised. Children, especially those under 5 years, spend a significant amount of their time in and around the home which exposes them to various injury hazards e.g. stairs and windows without safety grills, access to poisonous substances and chemicals, areas of open water, access to ground level stoves.  Despite an overall global reduction in child injury mortality rates over the past two decades, available data indicates that the rate of decline has been much slower in LMICs and the gap between LMICs and HICs is widening. This is due in part to higher risks, inadequate preventive measures and a lack of access to timely medical care in LMICs. The nature of household injuries among children has been well documented in HICs but much less is known in LMICs. Much of what is known about preventing child injuries in the home stems from research conducted in HICs where preventive measures have been shown to be effective e.g. safety caps, smoke alarms, stair gates coupled with education of parents/carers. What is not known is how effective these measures would be in LMICs.  This study aims to test the effectiveness of a child safety kit (developed through co-design to reflect differing risk profiles, cultural appropriateness and availability/affordability) against traditional education. The study will be carried out in Jinja, Uganda and will involve two phases: Phase 1 (the focus of this development grant, conducted over 1 year) will focus on contextualizing the child injury problem and developing the child safety kit through mixed methods (a review of hospital data, focus groups with parents/carers, in-depth interviews with key informants, an affordability/availability survey and a market survey to ascertain willingness to pay for safety equipment); and Phase 2 which will measure behaviour change and reductions in injuries through a cluster Randomised Control Trial (cRCT). We will assess the reduction in child injuries in two villages (clusters) - one which will have the full child safety kit of equipment plus educational material, workshops and awareness campaign for parents versus the other cluster with only education - over 3 years.  A key component of Phase 1 will be to support collaborative research between scientific researchers, policy makers and parents such that all stakeholders involved in the health of under 5's have the opportunity to be full participants from conceptualisation to communication of results. The co-design approach will result in the development of a holistic intervention to include the child safety kit, educational material, training workshops for parents and a community-based awareness campaign. Engaging the community from the beginning will result in improved knowledge and awareness through the sharing of opinions and experience and will optimise equipment usage during Phase 2.   The results of Phase 1 will identify any challenges to implementing the intervention, provide accurate data on which to calculate sample sizes for the cRCT and determine the key outcomes. To our knowledge, this will be the first cRCT on child safety equipment and education conducted in Africa.",

            "Nontyphoidal strains of Salmonella are a major cause of fatal bloodstream infection in Africa, particularly among young children and people living with HIV/AIDS. These Salmonella infections are difficult to diagnose and antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem, so an effective vaccine against nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) has the potential to save many lives. Vaccines currently in development against NTS aim to work by stimulating the production of antibodies to a sugar known as O-antigen which is part of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecule and found on the Salmonella surface. My previous research has shown that some HIV-infected adults in Africa have very high levels of these antibodies which then block killing of the Salmonella bacteria. Hence there is a risk that these vaccines may cause harm to people with HIV.  This project aims to understand the basis for susceptibility to NTS bloodstream infections in HIV-infected Africans, and in particular to understand the phenomenon of blocking antibodies, with a view to designing improved vaccines that will protect HIV-infected groups against NTS. I hypothesise that NTS is present at increased levels in the gut in HIV infection and that because the gut wall does not function properly in these patients, the Salmonella bacteria are able to invade the bloodstream. Here they can go on to cause severe disease and death due to the inability of the immune system to kill these bacteria, because of the presence of blocking levels of antibodies. I hypothesise that the continual movement of Salmonella and Salmonella LPS into the circulation drives the production of these high levels of blocking antibodies, because antibody production is no longer appropriately regulated in HIV infection.  I will test this hypothesis in a group of adults newly-diagnosed with HIV infection in Uganda, studying them for two years after they commence antiretroviral therapy (ART) and comparing them with HIV-uninfected subjects. Incidence of NTS bloodstream infections initially rises when starting ART and then falls, but remains much higher than in HIV-uninfected subjects. Therefore, looking at specific immune parameters with time on ART will help understand which are most relevant to susceptibility to NTS infection. Since compromise of the barrier state of the gut is key to my hypothesis, I will study samples of gut tissue taken at endoscopy, as well as peripheral blood.  First, I will test to see whether NTS is present in the gut of HIV-infected participants and whether it occurs more frequently and at higher levels than in HIV-uninfected controls. Then I will investigate the transfer of Salmonella from the gut to the bloodstream and compare this with the immune status of the gut wall, seeing whether this transfer is associated with loss of particular groups of immune cells known as Th17 and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. Finally, I will study the levels and function of antibodies targeting LPS O-antigen, to determine whether they block or kill Salmonella, comparing them with antibodies to a protein known as flagellin which is also present on the Salmonella surface. I will test whether levels and function of these antibodies associate with changes in the numbers and function of two further groups of immune cells, Tfh and Treg cells, which are infected by HIV and which regulate antibody production.  I will follow changes in these immune parameters in the group of HIV-infected participants over time on ART, and look for associations at time points with known differences in susceptibility to NTS. This will enable me to better understand which factors are most relevant for susceptibility to NTS, the mechanism of susceptibility and production of blocking antibodies, and what vaccine or other therapeutic strategies might best protect HIV-infected populations against NTS.",

            "Pathology is the science of the causes and effects of diseases, especially the branch of medicine that deals with the laboratory examination of samples of body tissue for diagnostic or forensic purposes that have been obtained from an affected part of the body while the patient is alive (biopsy) or dead (necropsy or autopsy). In medicine, pathologic examination of tissues from patients who have died can be helpful to establish the cause of death. Knowledge of cause of death is of importance for prioritizing and distribution of public health resources. In Vietnam pathology is not part of routine diagnostics of patients and is not routinely used to establish cause of death. Knowledge of cause of death in Vietnam is therefore limited, also due to limited diagnostic capacity and inadequate national recording and reporting systems. In infectious diseases, which are the cause of death of around 10-15% of all people who die, the cause of death is only known in a minority of cases.  In the proposed project we aim to do three things. 1. To explore the attitudes towards postmortem investigations 2. To build pathology capacity in two large infectious diseases hospitals 3. To evaluate the use of a novel way of doing autopsies by only taking small samples using hollow needles from different sites of the human body. This is called minimally invasive autopsy (MIA).   Attitudes: A social scientist will explore the attitudes and perceptions towards postmortem investigations and sampling among a) the general public by inviting people to complete an online survey in a press release in national newspapers and b) healthcare professionals, religious leaders and patients relatives during focus group discussions. We will discuss postmortem investigations and sampling in general, and full autopsy and MIA in particular. We will show a video of both full and minimally invasive autopsies and ask participants to comment, to discuss their perceptions and beliefs regarding both procedures on a professional and personal level. Capacity: Simultaneously, we will build capacity for pathology in the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases and Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi. This will include purchase of necessary equipment and consumables for taking and analysing biopsy and MIA samples, training of Vietnamese clinical and laboratory staff by UK based pathologists and enabling implementation of pathology in routine clinical diagnostics, e.g. liver biopsy in infectious diseases of the liver Evaluation: Evaluate the contribution of MIA to establish the cause of death in patients who have died from one of three infectious clinical syndromes: infection of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), of the lungs (pneumonia) and of the bloodstream (sepsis/septic shock). After obtaining permission from relatives, we will use the validated MIA protocols - adapted to be acceptable locally using information from the Attitude phase - to take samples from the deceased patient and we will use general and pathogen specific pathologic examination and highly sensitive molecular techniques that detect genetic information of almost all known infectious agents (next generation sequencing) to establish cause of death. We will do this on a total of 100 patients.   All OUCRU's work is made available in open-access publications, and will be presented at (inter)national conferences and at policy groups. Public Engagement (PE) activities will be designed and coordinated by the very active OUCRU PE team, working with project researchers and health workers in each site to implement and communicate these activities.",

            "Research Question What are effective, sustainable, and cost-effective strategies that target the causes and consequences of child injuries in Tanzania and Zimbabwe?Background Child injuries are a leading cause of death and disability globally. They cause a loss of economic productivity at individual, family, societal, and national levels, lead to catastrophic health expenditures, and impose a significant burden on healthcare systems. With simple, cost-effective interventions, many child injuries are preventable. However, a lack of reliable data on injury prevalence, care processes, and outcomes has hindered evidence-based policymaking in Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Our research programme aims to bridge this gap and contribute to national efforts to reduce child mortality and morbidity from injury. Tanzania and Zimbabwe have been chosen as research locations due to their high incidence of child injuries, modelled at 8.087 and 6.804 per 1000 person-years respectively, and their government’s commitment to reducing child mortality and morbidity from injury by 2030. Our research programme will address the World Health Organization’s World Report on Child Injury Prevention recommendations: 1) enhance the quality and quantity of data for child injury prevention, 2) research on the causes, consequences, costs, and prevention of child injuries, 3) implement specific actions to prevent and control child injuries, and 4) strengthen health systems to address child injuries. Aims and Objectives1) Assess the burden and determinants of child injuries across age groups, socio-demographic categories, and geographic regions; 2) Develop, implement, and evaluate cost-effective strategies for child injury prevention with scale-up across communities; 3) Determine the cost of service delivery across referral and district networks to guide evidence-based resource allocation; and 4) Develop, implement, and evaluate a sustainable community-led capacity building programme to improve child injury care.Methods We will employ a mixed-methods approach, using qualitative and quantitative methodologies for patient-level and health economic analyses. Our research will be guided by Complex Systems Theory and the Systems-Within-Systems Framework, acknowledging the interconnected nature of childhood trauma and the bidirectional influence between children and the broader systems they are embedded in.Anticipated impact and disseminationAligned with in-country child health improvement priorities, our research anticipates reducing child injury incidence and enhancing trauma care skills among clinicians, ultimately improving children's health. Findings will be disseminated through publications in public health, policy, and clinical journals and presentations at academic meetings. Policymakers will be equipped with comprehensive reports and policy briefs for informed decision-making. Healthcare practitioners will gain toolkits and health economic data for effective service delivery. The public will be engaged via various media outlets and advocacy groups, promoting awareness and safety practices. We foresee our programme influencing broader health systems and economic productivity, creating a ripple effect of benefits."

            "Injuries are the leading cause of death in people aged 10-49 years. More people die from injuries than from HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis combined. For every person who dies, up to 50 people survive but become disabled. Broken bones account for most of these injuries, and these happen more often to people living in poor regions, including some countries in Africa. Across Africa, little is known about how many people break a bone, what healthcare services are available to treat them, how a broken bone affects patients/families, and how to improve recovery.Our project has four parts:(1) RESEARCH TRAINING AND RESOURCES: Doctors, nurses and healthcare workers involved in the care of patients with broken bones have limited training in how to conduct research, and have poor access to the resources to do research. This makes it more difficult to improve the care for their patients. We will look at the current levels of research training and organization. We will design educational resources to fill gaps in the current understanding and ability to do research. (2) COUNTING BROKEN BONES: We will create a network of hospitals in our partner countries to study how often different types of broken bones occur. We will describe the resources (people and equipment) available to treat these injuries and how patients use these services. We collect this information for five broken bones that the World Health Organization (WHO) have identified to cause the most disability. (3) UNDERSTANDING RECOVERY: We will find out how patients in our partner countries recover from their broken bones, and how this impacts on their livelihoods and those who care for them. (4) STUDY FOR FUTURE RESEARCH: We want to understand how to do large-scale research for patients with broken bones throughout Africa. To do this we will run a small study in our network of hospitals to see what works well and what is challenging. This project will help us understand the number of broken bones that happen in Africa and what treatments are available to patients. It will develop research teams and guide us for future research studies. This works towards our vision that the care for broken bones in poor countries can be safe, accessible, and appropriate to the resources of local health systems. Community engagement and involvement: We have engaged with local patients and healthcare workers, whose opinions have informed our work so far. We will continue to integrate patients and community leaders to co-produce our research.Dissemination: Patients, clinicians and methodologists will co-develop publications, social media, and events. We will work alongside policy makers in national government ministries and strengthen our relationship with leaders within the WHO to ensure that we disseminate our findings effectively and influence policy to drive improved patient care.",
            "Across three African countries (Malawi, South Africa and Tanzania) we plan to: (1) develop the ability to research the care of people with broken bones, (2) determine the number of people affected by broken bones, (3) describe the healthcare resources available for the treatment of broken bones and work out what is important for the best delivery of services, (4) measure how a broken bone impacts the lives and livelihoods of patients and their carers, and (5) improve the recovery of patients with broken bones."

Enhancing local decision making by providing\rhigh resolution data that can enhance treatment strategies to the individual is key to improving\rinfection control. Placing individuals and their data in the context of regional and national interpretation\rcan aid understanding of transmission, pathogen population dynamics and public health risk.\rUltimately, enhancing real time linkage of data at multiple geographic scales will provide us with a\rglobally aware data landscape and enhance our ability to spot the emergence and spread of new\rthreats and lead to intelligent deployment of interventions and the monitoring of their impact. Whole\rGenome Sequencing (WGS) is a technology increasingly embraced within translational public health\rcommunities and offers the ability to provide information at an individual level, as well as at a regional,\rnational and international scale due to its digital nature.\rBarriers to uptake of WGS are broad, practical and political, eg technology rollout, implementation and\rembedding in current practice as well as supply chains and reagent availability.

This means that the country cooperation strategies and country support plans will have clear actions, measure results in every country and provide resources where needed. Furthermore, the Secretariat will work with Member States and non-State actors on country-specific priorities in order to achieve GPW 13.\nThe Secretariat will engage all countries in strategic, advocacy and policy dialogue, based on high-quality data and projections, in order to highlight how specific changes in policy could affect their health outcomes. In particular, the Secretariat will further develop and help implement the proposed Universal Health and Preparedness Review.\nReinforced by the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All, the Secretariat will work with Member States and non-State actors to ensure that WHO helps Member States to advance towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. This means that country cooperation strategies that are based on the national priorities, policies and plans and are in line with United Nations reform will be guided by GPW 13 and oriented towards the Sustainable Development Goals.\nUnder the Global Action Plan, the Secretariat will facilitate and enhance collaboration among the 12 agencies that play key roles in health, development and humanitarian response in order to accelerate progress on the health-related Sustainable Development Goals targets, including by hosting the Global Action Plan secretariat and providing leadership on its various inter-agency accelerator groups at the global level.\nThe Secretariat, through the aligned work of the three levels of the Organization, will lead the effort to convert the commitment of leading health and development organizations to work more closely together, as set out in the Global Action Plan, to take collective action in support of the implementation of national priorities in order to accelerate progress towards the health-related Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe Secretariat will promote more effective leadership at all levels, including by strengthening country office leadership, developing a fit-for-purpose staffing structure, providing appropriate delegation of authority and re-engineering business processes that facilitate effectiveness and efficiency.\nThe Secretariat will increase its internal capacity for health diplomacy, strengthen coherence in its external relations and increase its support for Member State delegations in the area of health diplomacy and participation in governing body meetings.\nThe Secretariat will convene the governing bodies in a manner that aligns the WHO work agenda with the Sustainable Development Goals through effective and efficient processes, including the design and application of innovative solutions to support the preparation and delivery of meetings of the governing bodies. In addition, it will implement the outcomes of ongoing Member State consultations on governance reform in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner, applying the lessons learned from governing body processes, including in respect of special procedures for conducting ?virtual? and ?hybrid? meetings and novel agenda management modalities.\nThe Secretariat will bring a gender perspective to leadership and governance and encourage the participation of young people. It will provide effective support to governing body sessions, with efficient and aligned agendas that are focused on the Sustainable Development Goals and United Nations reform.",

            "Drug theft is one of the most common and lucrative forms of public corruption within the health sector of many developing countries. In addition to the growth-inhibiting and poverty-inducing effects that accompany corruption, drug theft slows the fight against preventable diseases like malaria and bacterial infection. In collaboration with the Drug Theft Investigations Unit at the Malawi Ministry of Health, we will experimentally evaluate whether top-down audits and bottom-up community monitoring can reduce drug theft. Additionally, we introduce a novel measurement protocol that uses radio and GPS tracking devices to measure rates of theft at different levels of the medications supply chain. This allows us to move beyond existing studies of corruption that focus on changes in corruption levels to present evidence demonstrating how anti-corruption interventions displace corruption to other parts of the system. Our project directly builds on existing anti-corruption priorities among development stakeholders in Malawi."

            "This project will provide the data, analyses, ideas and partnerships to accelerate the transition to a sustainable global trade system that reduces impacts on biodiversity and people, increases the social benefits of wildlife use and agricultural production, and fulfils the SDG's mission to �leave no-one behind�. This TRADE hub will develop new and long-overdue areas of cross-disciplinary science to analyse, understand, and increase the traceability and transparency of impacts for sub-national, national and global trade flows. It will, in parallel, and adopting a model of co-design, facilitate collaborations among research groups and private and public sector institutions working on trade within and across continents, and between Developing Countries and the UK. These collaborations will enhance the relevance, and promote the uptake, of our research, supporting decision-makers at all scales to develop and implement relevant policy and regulations. The scale of the challenge and time-frames associated with transitions in a complex trade system mean that large-scale impacts are only likely to be realised after the end of the hub. A key outcome will thus be to ensure that significant capacity and momentum is built across our partnership to continue the work on public policy and industry engagement well into the future."

            "Our project's overarching research question is: How do African societies design and implement climate action to improve sustainable livelihoods, and reduce both poverty and inequality? For example, all African countries need to adapt their food systems to be more resilient to climate change, but there are different routes to achieving this - such as investing in largescale industrialised agriculture or supporting small-scale farmers to be more climate smart - which can result in very different livelihood benefits across society.Our second objective is to build a network of African-UK researchers who can bring deep disciplinary expertise to bear on this interdisciplinary problem. In particular, our project brings together two newly-established ARUA Centres of Excellence (CoE) on climate change and inequalities, with world-leading expertise from the UK, to form this network and to work at the nexus of climate change, inequality and poverty"

The goal is to map the fragmentation of peacemaking and peacebuilding approaches and to assess to what extent non-Western approaches work in complementarity with Western statebuilding efforts, and to what extent they present a competing vision of peacemaking and peacebuilding that is in competition with more normative approaches to statebuilding. We aim to examine not just the alternative practices, but also provide an appraisal of whether and how these practices challenge the normative order developed in the aftermath of the Cold War, and underpinning peacebuilding practice since then. This mapping is a Phase One baseline study, across a range of case studies and domains, which could be built on if findings and funds permitted."

            "The government of Addis Ababa recently announced plans to redevelop large central areas of the city, which will lead to the relocation of 20,000 households out of informal settlements. This presents a unique opportunity to learn. Building on a sample of 30,000 geo-referenced surveys conducted in Addis before the announcement, we will estimate both the direct effect of being relocated out of a dense city centre, as well as the externalities of the relocations, on labour markets in the surrounding areas. We will draw on a variety of empirical techniques from labour and urban economics to estimate how these spillover effects extend over space. In doing so will develop new methods for studying both treatment effects and externalities in dense urban labour markets, where labour markets are not defined by geographically distinct clusters."

The data building activities within the G2LM-LIC project will address this challenge and facilitate the next stage of research on jobs and poverty by building the Global Jobs Database (GJD) which acts as a platform to harmonise all available micro datasets that contain information on labour market activities and poverty to create a multi-country macro data-set that contains, at a minimum: labor force participation, occupational choice (sector, casual vs regular, wage vs self-employment), earnings, hours worked, seasonality all by gender, ethnicity (where relevant), education, and wealth."

By combining detailed, monthly VAT micro-data from Ugandan and Rwandan firms between 2010 and 2021, this project will be the first to document how cross-border shocks affect the growth process via their impacts on domestic production networks."

Beyond the notable health impacts identified in the evaluation, we hypothesize that the program's benefits may extend significantly beyond its primary health focus. Specifically, we believe that communities where Community Health Assistants (CHAs) were recruited and stationed – as of the better health and higher job aspirations – might be more likely to have initiated a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop which we call \"Virtuous Cycle\"."

Train staff in TB and hepatitis services to identify depression and deliver treatment.\r2. Provide specialist supervision for non-mental health specialists in those settings.\r3. Release staff and other resources to help integrate depression care.\r4. Scale up and sustain integrated provision.\r5. Explore with patients the acceptability of routine depression case-finding and treatment within TB/ chronic hepatitis care and potential adverse outcomes of integration.\r\rWork stream 2: Run co-designed workshops with patients and healthcare staff to develop plans, pathways and materials for integrating depression care in TB and chronic hepatitis services.\r\rWork stream 3: Test feasibility of plans and materials for depression case-finding.\r1. Identify and train staff in exemplar sites to case find using standard instruments.\r2. Collect quantitative and qualitative data form audits, focus groups and individual interviews.\r3. Revise plans, materials, future intervention and trial design based on results.\r4. Develop new partnerships with National TB programmes and hepatitis services in partner countries.\r5.
