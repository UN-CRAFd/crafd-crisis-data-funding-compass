The forecasting methodology is explicitly designed to detect new, subtle signals of conflict risk in countries not currently at war. Detecting these risks is extremely difficult and requires accepting false positives. These predictions are then integrated into a novel policy evaluation tool to assess the tradeoff between the benefits of preventive action and the costs of acting on false-positive signals."

By integrating these drivers into one analytical stream, it delivers actionable insights tailored to conflict-affected and climate-vulnerable populations, filling critical gaps and enabling anticipatory action. Led by the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, together with the Netherlands Red Cross’ 510 Initiative and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the risk data supports more informed and anticipatory decision-making across the humanitarian system.

Many of the locations where these disasters occur are not represented on open and accessible maps, leaving first responders without the critical information needed to make informed decisions about relief efforts. Missing Maps is an open, collaborative project designed to map areas where humanitarian organizations are working to address the needs of people living at risk of disasters and crises. This initiative enables volunteers to contribute to mapping efforts, helping to ensure that vulnerable communities are visible and better supported during emergencies."

Through the UNROCA instrument, Member States are requested, on an annual basis, to report their international transfers of seven categories of major conventional arms, as well as small arms and light weapons. They may also provide additional background information, such as data on military holdings and procurement through national production. To date, 175 Member States have reported to the UNROCA instrument at least once. In light of relatively consistent reporting by the world’s largest arms exporters, it is estimated that the Register captures around 90 percent of the volume of the global arms trade."

CDRs are datasets automatically generated by mobile operators for billing purposes, regardless of phone type, and represent an attractive data source for estimating internal migration and displacement, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where data on human mobility are often scarce. These methods enable a more comprehensive understanding of population dynamics, supporting evidence-based decision making in critical sectors."

Using these data, Flowminder has developed a new methodology to support decision makers in identifying optimal locations for their services and to facilitate data-driven decision making."

In recent decades, however, the field has witnessed the emergence of a new group of non-governmental actors known as Peace Facilitation Organizations (PFOs). PFOs are defined as independent organizations whose work consists of facilitating, advising, supporting, or implementing peace mediation or dialogue initiatives. The PFOs mapping dataset documents the PFOs that currently operate worldwide and provides information on their background, structure, approach, modus operandi, funding model, and other characteristics. The mapping aims to shed light on this field and identify these organizations, primarily from Western countries, that have professionalized peace mediation and contributed a certain degree of dexterity and standardization to peace processes."

Many of the locations where these disasters occur are not represented on open and accessible maps, leaving first responders without the critical information needed to make informed decisions about relief efforts. Missing Maps is an open, collaborative project designed to map areas where humanitarian organizations are working to address the needs of people living at risk of disasters and crises. This initiative enables volunteers to contribute to mapping efforts, helping to ensure that vulnerable communities are visible and better supported during emergencies."

Many of the locations where these disasters occur are not represented on open and accessible maps, leaving first responders without the critical information needed to make informed decisions about relief efforts. Missing Maps is an open, collaborative project designed to map areas where humanitarian organizations are working to address the needs of people living at risk of disasters and crises. This initiative enables volunteers to contribute to mapping efforts, helping to ensure that vulnerable communities are visible and better supported during emergencies."

It assesses the availability and quality of care for a wide range of services, with a particular focus on antenatal care (ANC), family planning (FP), maternity care, and sick child services. Quality of Care measures are evaluated across two dimensions: structural quality, which includes physical and human resources, and process quality, which encompasses the provision of care and the experience of care."

PRIMES integrates all of UNHCR’s digital registration, identity management, and case management tools into a single, internally connected and interoperable ecosystem.\n\nPRIMES consists of several repositories for personal data, including both biographic and biometric information, as well as supporting data. It incorporates multiple tools that securely utilize this information to deliver targeted protection, assistance, and solutions to refugees and other displaced populations. PRIMES enables a range of functions, including:\n\n- Identity management, encompassing registration, biometric enrolment, and documentation\n- Case management, covering key protection aspects such as Refugee Status Determination, Resettlement, Statelessness, Repatriation, Legal and Physical Protection, Child Protection, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV), and others\n- Assistance, including both cash and in-kind support\n- Data management, which includes reporting and analysis to support evidence-informed action for quality protection outcomes\n\nPRIMES is designed with cooperation and interoperability as core principles, allowing governments and partners supporting refugees to utilize the data and technology developed by UNHCR. This enhances their capacity to deliver services, often in collaboration with UNHCR, in a safe and secure manner. PRIMES is fully aligned with the Policy on the Protection of Personal Data of Persons of Concern to UNHCR."

Covering topics such as protection, health, education, shelter, livelihoods, and food security, the survey offers critical data to inform evidence-based planning and prioritization, ensuring the specific needs of different refugee groups are addressed. Data collection was conducted through face-to-face interviews from May to July 2024 with a probability-based random sample of refugee households, managed collaboratively by UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration. Findings will guide strategic interventions and resource allocation to enhance the welfare and resilience of the refugee population in Estonia."

By providing forecasts at a subnational level, CLIFDEW-GRID offers a more nuanced understanding of in-country heterogeneity compared to traditional country-level approaches. The system will be piloted in selected countries in Western and Eastern Africa.\n\nCLIFDEW-GRID functions as an early warning, grid-based modeling system designed to predict potential climate-induced forced displacement. It is a joint, innovative data project led by UNHCR and the University of California Irvine, with financial support from the Complex Risk Analytics Fund (CRAF’d)."

By providing forecasts at a subnational level, CLIFDEW-GRID offers a more nuanced understanding of in-country heterogeneity compared to traditional country-level approaches. The system will be piloted in selected countries in Western and Eastern Africa.\n\nCLIFDEW-GRID functions as an early warning, grid-based modeling system designed to predict potential climate-induced forced displacement. It is a joint, innovative data project led by UNHCR and the University of California Irvine, with financial support from the Complex Risk Analytics Fund (CRAF’d)."
