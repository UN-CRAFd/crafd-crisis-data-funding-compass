Through the UNROCA instrument, Member States are requested, on an annual basis, to report their international transfers of seven categories major conventional arms, as well as small arms and light weapons. They may also provide additional background information, such as data on military holdings and procurement through national production. To date, 175 Member States have reported to the UNROCA instrument at least once. In light of relatively consistent reporting by the world’s largest arms exporters, it is estimated that the Register captures around 90 percent of the volume of the global arms trade.\n",

Their World Climate Data and Monitoring Programme (WCDMP) coordinates climate data and assessment, while initiatives like data rescue projects, including the MEditerranean climate DAta REscue (MEDARE) project and the International Environmental Data Rescue Organization (IEDRO), work to digitize historical data for research and analysis. The WMO also implements the WMO Hydrological Observing System (WHOS) through the WMO HydroHub to facilitate data sharing and capacity building in hydrology.",

Covering topics such as protection, health, education, shelter, livelihoods, and food security, the survey offers critical data to inform evidence-based planning and prioritization, ensuring the specific needs of different refugee groups are addressed. Data collection was conducted through face-to-face interviews from May to July 2024 with a probability-based random sample of refugee households, managed collaboratively by UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration.
